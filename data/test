I was never so\nberhym'd since Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat, which I\ncan hardly remember.\nIs it a man?\nI prithee, who?\nNay, but who is it?\nNay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell\nme who it is.\nGood my complexion! dost thou think, though I am\ncaparison'd like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my\ndisposition?

I would\nthou could'st stammer, that thou mightst pour this conceal'd man\nout of thy mouth, as wine comes out of narrow-mouth'd bottle-\neither too much at once or none at all. I prithee take the cork\nout of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.\nIs he of God's making? What manner of man?\nIs his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?\nWhy, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let\nme stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the\nknowledge of his chin.\nNay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true\nmaid.\nOrlando?\nAlas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?\nWhat did he when thou saw'st him? What said he? How look'd he?\nWherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where\nremains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him\nagain? Answer me in one word.\nBut doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's\napparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?\nIt may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops forth\nsuch fruit.\nProceed.\nThough it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes\nthe ground.\nO, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.\nDo you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak.\nSweet, say on.\n'Tis he; slink by, and note him.\nI will speak to him like a saucy lackey,\nand under that habit play the knave with him.- Do you hear,\nforester?\nI pray you, what is't o'clock?\nThen there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing\nevery minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot\nof Time as well as a clock.\nBy no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with\ndivers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time\ntrots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still\nwithal.\nMarry, he trots hard with a young maid between the\ncontract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd; if the\ninterim be but a se'nnight, Time's pace is so hard that it seems\nthe length of seven year.\nWith a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath\nnot the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study,\nand the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one\nlacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other\nknowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These Time ambles\nwithal.\nWith a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly\nas foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.\nWith lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term\nand term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.\nWith this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of\nthe forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.\nAs the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.\nI have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious\nuncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland\nman; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love.\nI have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank God I\nam not a woman, to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he\nhath generally tax'd their whole sex withal.\nThere were none principal; they were all like one another\nas halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his\nfellow-fault came to match it.\nNo; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are\nsick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young\nplants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes upon\nhawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the\nname of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give\nhim some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love\nupon him.\nThere is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me\nhow to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure you\nare not prisoner.\nA lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,\nwhich you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not;\na beard neglected, which you have not; but I pardon you for that,\nfor simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue.\nThen your hose should be ungarter'd, your bonnet unbanded, your\nsleeve unbutton'd, your shoe untied, and every thing about you\ndemonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man; you\nare rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself\nthan seeming the lover of any other.\nMe believe it! You may as soon make her that you love\nbelieve it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess\nshe does. That is one of the points in the which women still give\nthe lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that\nhangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?\nBut are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?\nLove is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as\nwell a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why\nthey are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so\nordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing\nit by counsel.\nYes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his\nlove, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me; at which\ntime would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate,\nchangeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish,\nshallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every\npassion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and\nwomen are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like\nhim, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now\nweep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his\nmad humour of love to a living humour of madness; which was, to\nforswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook\nmerely monastic. And thus I cur'd him; and this way will I take\nupon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart,\nthat there shall not be one spot of love in 't.\nI would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and\ncome every day to my cote and woo me.\nGo with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,\nyou shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?\nNay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you\ngo? \nNever talk to me; I will weep.\nBut have I not cause to weep?\nHis very hair is of the dissembling colour.\nI' faith, his hair is of a good colour.\nAnd his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of\nholy bread.\nBut why did he swear he would come this morning, and\ncomes not?\nDo you think so?\nNot true in love?\nYou have heard him swear downright he was.\nI met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.\nHe asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good as\nhe; so he laugh'd and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when\nthere is such a man as Orlando?\nO, come, let us remove!\nThe sight of lovers feedeth those in love.\nBring us to this sight, and you shall say\nI'll prove a busy actor in their play. \nAnd why, I pray you? Who might be your\nmother,\nThat you insult, exult, and all at once,\nOver the wretched? What though you have no beauty-\nAs, by my faith, I see no more in you\nThan without candle may go dark to bed-\nMust you be therefore proud and pitiless?\nWhy, what means this? Why do you look on me?\nI see no more in you than in the ordinary\nOf nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,\nI think she means to tangle my eyes too!\nNo faith, proud mistress, hope not after it;\n'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,\nYour bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,\nThat can entame my spirits to your worship.\nYou foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,\nLike foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?\nYou are a thousand times a properer man\nThan she a woman. 'Tis such fools as you\nThat makes the world full of ill-favour'd children.\n'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;\nAnd out of you she sees herself more proper\nThan any of her lineaments can show her.\nBut, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees,\nAnd thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;\nFor I must tell you friendly in your ear:\nSell when you can; you are not for all markets.\nCry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;\nFoul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.\nSo take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.\nHe's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall\nin love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee\nwith frowning looks, I'll sauce her with bitter words. Why look\nyou so upon me?\nI pray you do not fall in love with me,\nFor I am falser than vows made in wine;\nBesides, I like you not. If you will know my house,\n'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.\nWill you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.\nCome, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,\nAnd be not proud; though all the world could see,\nNone could be so abus'd in sight as he.\nCome, to our flock.  ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN\nThey say you are a melancholy fellow.\nThose that are in extremity of either are abominable\nfellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than\ndrunkards.\nWhy then, 'tis good to be a post.\nA traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be\nsad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then\nto have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and\npoor hands.\nAnd your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a\nfool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to\ntravel for it too.\nFarewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear\nstrange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be\nout of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making\nyou that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have\nswam in a gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where\nhave you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such\nanother trick, never come in my sight more.\nBreak an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a\nminute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the\nthousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said\nof him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder, but I'll\nwarrant him heart-whole.\nNay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had\nas lief be woo'd of a snail.\nAy, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries\nhis house on his head- a better jointure, I think, than you make\na woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.\nWhy, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to\nyour wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents\nthe slander of his wife.\nAnd I am your Rosalind.\nCome, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,\nand like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I\nwere your very very Rosalind?\nNay, you were better speak first; and when you were\ngravell'd for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.\nVery good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for\nlovers lacking- God warn us!- matter, the cleanliest shift is to\nkiss.\nThen she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new\nmatter.\nMarry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I\nshould think my honesty ranker than my wit.\nNot out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.\nAm not I your Rosalind?\nWell, in her person, I say I will not have you.\nNo, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six\nthousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man\ndied in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had\nhis brains dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he\ncould to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love.\nLeander, he would have liv'd many a fair year, though Hero had\nturn'd nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for,\ngood youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and,\nbeing taken with the cramp, was drown'd; and the foolish\nchroniclers of that age found it was- Hero of Sestos. But these\nare all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have\neaten them, but not for love.\nBy this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I\nwill be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me\nwhat you will, I will grant it.\nYes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.\nAy, and twenty such.\nAre you not good?\nWhy then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,\nsister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. Give me your hand,\nOrlando. What do you say, sister?\nYou must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-\nAy, but when?\nThen you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'\nI might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,\nOrlando, for my husband. There's a girl goes before the priest;\nand, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions.\nNow tell me how long you would have her, after you have\npossess'd her.\nSay 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are\nApril when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May when\nthey are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will\nbe more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,\nmore clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than\nan ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for\nnothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you\nare dispos'd to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when\nthou are inclin'd to sleep.\nBy my life, she will do as I do.\nOr else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,\nthe waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out\nat the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop\nthat, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.\nNay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your\nwife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.\nMarry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never\ntake her without her answer, unless you take her without her\ntongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's\noccasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will\nbreed it like a fool!\nAlas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!\nAy, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would\nprove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That\nflattering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and\nso, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?\nBy my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and\nby all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot\nof your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will\nthink you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow\nlover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may\nbe chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore\nbeware my censure, and keep your promise.\nWell, Time is the old justice that examines all such\noffenders, and let Time try. Adieu. \nO coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst\nknow how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded;\nmy affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.\nNo; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of\nthought, conceiv'd of spleen, and born of madness; that blind\nrascally boy, that abuses every one's eyes, because his own are\nout- let him be judge how deep I am in love. I'll tell thee,\nAliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I'll go find a\nshadow, and sigh till he come.\nHow say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?\nAnd here much Orlando!\nPatience herself would startle at this letter,\nAnd play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.\nShe says I am not fair, that I lack manners;\nShe calls me proud, and that she could not love me,\nWere man as rare as Phoenix. 'Od's my will!\nHer love is not the hare that I do hunt;\nWhy writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,\nThis is a letter of your own device.\nCome, come, you are a fool,\nAnd turn'd into the extremity of love.\nI saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,\nA freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think\nThat her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands;\nShe has a huswife's hand- but that's no matter.\nI say she never did invent this letter:\nThis is a man's invention, and his hand.\nWhy, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;\nA style for challengers. Why, she defies me,\nLike Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain\nCould not drop forth such giant-rude invention,\nSuch Ethiope words, blacker in their effect\nThan in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?\nShe Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.\n'Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,\nThat a maiden's heart hath burn'd?'\nCan a woman rail thus?\n'Why, thy godhead laid apart,\nWarr'st thou with a woman's heart?'\nDid you ever hear such railing?\n'Whiles the eye of man did woo me,\nThat could do no vengeance to me.'\nMeaning me a beast.\n'If the scorn of your bright eyne\nHave power to raise such love in mine,\nAlack, in me what strange effect\nWould they work in mild aspect!\nWhiles you chid me, I did love;\nHow then might your prayers move!\nHe that brings this love to the\nLittle knows this love in me;\nAnd by him seal up thy mind,\nWhether that thy youth and kind\nWill the faithful offer take\nOf me and all that I can make;\nOr else by him my love deny,\nAnd then I'll study how to die.'\nDo you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love\nsuch a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false\nstrains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,\nfor I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-\nthat if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,\nI will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a\ntrue lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.\nI am. What must we understand by this?\nBut, to Orlando: did he leave him there,\nFood to the suck'd and hungry lioness?\nWas't you he rescu'd?\nBut for the bloody napkin?\nI would I were at home.\nI do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think\nthis was well counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how\nwell I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!\nCounterfeit, I assure you.\nSo I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by\nright.\nI shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my\ncounterfeiting to him. Will you go? \nGod save you, brother.\nO, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear\nthy heart in a scarf!\nI thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a\nlion.\nDid your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon\nwhen he show'd me your handkercher?\nO, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never\nany thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar's\nthrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and overcame.' For your brother\nand my sister no sooner met but they look'd; no sooner look'd but\nthey lov'd; no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd; no sooner sigh'd but\nthey ask'd one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but\nthey sought the remedy- and in these degrees have they made pair\nof stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else\nbe incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of\nlove, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.\nWhy, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for\nRosalind?\nI will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking. Know\nof me then- for now I speak to some purpose- that I know you are\na gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should\nbear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you\nare; neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some\nlittle measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and\nnot to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do\nstrange things. I have, since I was three year old, convers'd\nwith a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable.\nIf you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries\nit out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her. I\nknow into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not\nimpossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set\nher before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without any\ndanger.\nBy my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I\nam a magician. Therefore put you in your best array, bid your\nfriends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall; and to\nRosalind, if you will.\nLook, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.\nI care not if I have. It is my study\nTo seem despiteful and ungentle to you.\nYou are there follow'd by a faithful shepherd;\nLook upon him, love him; he worships you.\nAnd I for no woman.\nAnd I for no woman.\nAnd so am I for no woman.\nWhy do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?'\nPray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish\nwolves against the moon. I will help you if I can.\nI would love you if I could.- To-morrow meet me all\ntogether. I will marry you if ever I marry woman,\nand I'll be married to-morrow. I will satisfy you if\never I satisfied man, and you shall be married to-morrow. \nI will content you if what pleases you contents you, and\nyou shall be married to-morrow. As you love\nRosalind, meet. As you love Phebe, meet;- and as I\nlove no woman, I'll meet. So, fare you well; I have left you\ncommands.\nPatience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd:\nYou say, if I bring in your Rosalind,\nYou will bestow her on Orlando here?\nAnd you say you will have her when I bring her?\nYou say you'll marry me, if I be willing?\nBut if you do refuse to marry me,\nYou'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?\nYou say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?\nI have promis'd to make all this matter even.\nKeep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter;\nYou yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter;\nKeep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,\nOr else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd;\nKeep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her\nIf she refuse me; and from hence I go,\nTo make these doubts all even.\nTo you I give myself, for I am yours.\nTo you I give myself, for I am yours.\nI'll have no father, if you be not he;\nI'll have no husband, if you be not he;\nNor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.\nIt is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but\nit is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it\nbe true that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play\nneeds no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and\ngood plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a\ncase am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot\ninsinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not\nfurnish'd like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My\nway is to conjure you; and I'll begin with the women. I charge\nyou, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of\nthis play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love\nyou bear to women- as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you\nhates them- that between you and the women the play may please.\nIf I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that\npleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defied\nnot; and, I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces,\nor sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,\nbid me farewell.\n", 'F'), ("Who were those went by?\nAnd whither go they?\nWhat was his cause of anger?\nGood; and what of him?\nSo do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.\nBut how should this man, that makes\nme smile, make Hector angry?\nWho comes here?\nHector's a gallant man.\nGood morrow, uncle Pandarus.\nThis morning, uncle.\nHector was gone, but Helen was not up.\nThat were we talking of, and of his anger.\nSo he says here.\nWhat, is he angry too?\nO Jupiter! there's no comparison.\nAy, if I ever saw him before and knew him.\nThen you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.\n'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.\nSo he is.\nHe is not Hector.\nExcuse me.\nPardon me, pardon me.\nHe shall not need it, if he have his own.\nNo matter.\n'Twould not become him; his own's better.\nNo, but brown.\nTo say the truth, true and not true.\nWhy, Paris hath colour enough.\nThen Troilus should have too much: if she praised\nhim above, his complexion is higher than his; he\nhaving colour enough, and the other higher, is too\nflaming a praise for a good complexion.

Besides, the gods\nWill have fulfill'd their secret purposes;\nFor has not the divine Apollo said,\nIs't not the tenor of his oracle,\nThat King Leontes shall not have an heir\nTill his lost child be found? which that it shall,\nIs all as monstrous to our human reason\nAs my Antigonus to break his grave\nAnd come again to me; who, on my life,\nDid perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel\nMy lord should to the heavens be contrary,\nOppose against their wills.\nCare not for issue;\nThe crown will find an heir: great Alexander\nLeft his to the worthiest; so his successor\nWas like to be the best.\nAnd left them\nMore rich for what they yielded.\nHad she such power,\nShe had just cause.\nI should so.\nWere I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark\nHer eye, and tell me for what dull part in't\nYou chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears\nShould rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd\nShould be 'Remember mine.'\nWill you swear\nNever to marry but by my free leave?\nThen, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.\nUnless another,\nAs like Hermione as is her picture,\nAffront his eye.CLEOMENES.

But here it is: prepare\nTo see the life as lively mock'd as ever\nStill sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.\nI like your silence, it the more shows off\nYour wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,\nComes it not something near?\nSo much the more our carver's excellence;\nWhich lets go by some sixteen years and makes her\nAs she lived now.\nO, patience!\nThe statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.\nIndeed, my lord,\nIf I had thought the sight of my poor image\nWould thus have wrought you,\xe2\x80\x94for the stone is mine\xe2\x80\x94\nI'ld not have show'd it.\nNo longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy\nMay think anon it moves.\nI'll draw the curtain:\nMy lord's almost so far transported that\nHe'll think anon it lives.\nI am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but\nI could afflict you farther.\nGood my lord, forbear:\nThe ruddiness upon her lip is wet;\nYou'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own\nWith oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?\nEither forbear,\nQuit presently the chapel, or resolve you\nFor more amazement. If you can behold it,\nI'll make the statue move indeed, descend\nAnd take you by the hand; but then you'll think\xe2\x80\x94\nWhich I protest against\xe2\x80\x94I am assisted\nBy wicked powers.\nIt is required\nYou do awake your faith. Then all stand still;\nOn: those that think it is unlawful business\nI am about, let them depart.\nMusic, awake her; strike!\n'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;\nStrike all that look upon with marvel. Come,\nI'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,\nBequeath to death your numbness, for from him\nDear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:\nStart not; her actions shall be holy as\nYou hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her\nUntil you see her die again; for then\nYou kill her double. Nay, present your hand:\nWhen she was young you woo'd her; now in age\nIs she become the suitor?\nThat she is living,\nWere it but told you, should be hooted at\nLike an old tale: but it appears she lives,\nThough yet she speak not. Mark a little while.\nPlease you to interpose, fair madam: kneel\nAnd pray your mother's blessing.

Take thou that:\nLive, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.\nThou detestable maw, thou womb of death,\nGorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,\nThus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,\nAnd, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!\nI must indeed; and therefore came I hither.\nGood gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;\nFly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;\nLet them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,\nPut not another sin upon my head,\nBy urging me to fury: O, be gone!\nBy heaven, I love thee better than myself;\nFor I come hither arm'd against myself:\nStay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,\nA madman's mercy bade thee run away.\nWilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!\nIn faith, I will.

O, give me thy hand,\nOne writ with me in sour misfortune's book!\nI'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;\nA grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,\nFor here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\nThis vault a feasting presence full of light.\nDeath, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.\nHow oft when men are at the point of death\nHave they been merry! which their keepers call\nA lightning before death: O, how may I\nCall this a lightning?

Ah, dear Juliet,\nWhy art thou yet so fair? shall I believe\nThat unsubstantial death is amorous,\nAnd that the lean abhorred monster keeps\nThee here in dark to be his paramour?\nFor fear of that, I still will stay with thee;\nAnd never from this palace of dim night\nDepart again: here, here will I remain\nWith worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here\nWill I set up my everlasting rest,\nAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\nFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!\nArms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you\nThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\nA dateless bargain to engrossing death!\nCome, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!\nThou desperate pilot, now at once run on\nThe dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!\nHere's to my love!\nO true apothecary!\nThy drugs are quick.

For myself, son,\nI purpose not to wait on fortune till\nThese wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee\nRather to show a noble grace to both parts\nThan seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner\nMarch to assault thy country than to tread\xe2\x80\x94\nTrust to't, thou shalt not\xe2\x80\x94on thy mother's womb,\nThat brought thee to this world.\nNay, go not from us thus.\nIf it were so that our request did tend\nTo save the Romans, thereby to destroy\nThe Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,\nAs poisonous of your honour: no; our suit\nIs that you reconcile them: while the Volsces\nMay say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,\n'This we received;' and each in either side\nGive the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest\nFor making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,\nThe end of war's uncertain, but this certain,\nThat, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit\nWhich thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,\nWhose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;\nWhose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,\nBut with his last attempt he wiped it out;\nDestroy'd his country, and his name remains\nTo the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:\nThou hast affected the fine strains of honour,\nTo imitate the graces of the gods;\nTo tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,\nAnd yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt\nThat should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?\nThink'st thou it honourable for a noble man\nStill to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:\nHe cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:\nPerhaps thy childishness will move him more\nThan can our reasons. There's no man in the world\nMore bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate\nLike one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life\nShow'd thy dear mother any courtesy,\nWhen she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,\nHas cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,\nLoaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,\nAnd spurn me back: but if it be not so,\nThou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,\nThat thou restrain'st from me the duty which\nTo a mother's part belongs. He turns away:\nDown, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.\nTo his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride\nThan pity to our prayers. Down: an end;\nThis is the last: so we will home to Rome,\nAnd die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:\nThis boy, that cannot tell what he would have\nBut kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,\nDoes reason our petition with more strength\nThan thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:\nThis fellow had a Volscian to his mother;\nHis wife is in Corioli and his child\nLike him by chance.

It\nis not politic in the commonwealth of nature to\npreserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational\nincrease and there was never virgin got till\nvirginity was first lost. That you were made of is\nmetal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost\nmay be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is\never lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!\nThere's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the\nrule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,\nis to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible\ndisobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:\nvirginity murders itself and should be buried in\nhighways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate\noffendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,\nmuch like a cheese; consumes itself to the very\nparing, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.\nBesides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of\nself-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the\ncanon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose\nby't: out with 't! within ten year it will make\nitself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the\nprincipal itself not much the worse: away with 't!\nLet me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it\nlikes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with\nlying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't\nwhile 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.\nVirginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out\nof fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just\nlike the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not\nnow. Your date is better in your pie and your\nporridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,\nyour old virginity, is like one of our French\nwithered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,\n'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;\nmarry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?\nWhat one, i' faith?\nWhat's pity?\nLittle Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I\nwill think of thee at court.\nUnder Mars, I.\nWhy under Mars?\nWhen he was predominant.\nWhy think you so?\nThat's for advantage.\nI am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee\nacutely.

As good luck would have it, comes\nin one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's\napproach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's\ndistraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.\nBy the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul\nshirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy\nnapkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest\ncompound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.\nNay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have\nsuffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.\nBeing thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's\nknaves, his hinds, were called forth by their\nmistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to\nDatchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met\nthe jealous knave their master in the door, who\nasked them once or twice what they had in their\nbasket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave\nwould have searched it; but fate, ordaining he\nshould be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he\nfor a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But\nmark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs\nof three several deaths; first, an intolerable\nfright, to be detected with a jealous rotten\nbell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good\nbilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to\npoint, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,\nlike a strong distillation, with stinking clothes\nthat fretted in their own grease: think of that,\xe2\x80\x94a\nman of my kidney,\xe2\x80\x94think of that,\xe2\x80\x94that am as subject\nto heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution\nand thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.\nAnd in the height of this bath, when I was more than\nhalf stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be\nthrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,\nin that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of\nthat,\xe2\x80\x94hissing hot,\xe2\x80\x94think of that, Master Brook.\nMaster Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have\nbeen into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her\nhusband is this morning gone a-birding: I have\nreceived from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt\neight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.\nIs it? I will then address me to my appointment.\nCome to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall\nknow how I speed; and the conclusion shall be\ncrowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall\nhave her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall\ncuckold Ford.\nMistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my\nsufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love,\nand I profess requital to a hair's breadth; not\nonly, Mistress Ford, in the simple\noffice of love, but in all the accoutrement,\ncomplement and ceremony of it.

Go; say the woman told me so.\nAy, sir; like who more bold.\nAy, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught\nme more wit than ever I learned before in my life;\nand I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for\nmy learning.\nI would all the world might be cozened; for I have\nbeen cozened and beaten too. If it should come to\nthe ear of the court, how I have been transformed\nand how my transformation hath been washed and\ncudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by\ndrop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant\nthey would whip me with their fine wits till I were\nas crest-fallen as a dried pear.

Well, if my\nwind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.\nNow, whence come you?\nThe devil take one party and his dam the other! and\nso they shall be both bestowed.

I'll hold. This is\nthe third time; I hope good luck lies in odd\nnumbers. Away I go. They say there is divinity in\nodd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death.

Be you in the\nPark about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall\nsee wonders.\nI went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor\nold man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like a\npoor old woman.

I will tell\nyou: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a\nwoman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear\nnot Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know\nalso life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along\nwith me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I\nplucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew\nnot what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow\nme: I'll tell you strange things of this knave\nFord, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I\nwill deliver his wife into your hand. Follow.\nStrange things in hand, Master Brook!

O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew\nto the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in\nthe form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And\nthen another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think\non 't, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot\nbacks, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a\nWindsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the\nforest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can\nblame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? my\ndoe?\nMy doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain\npotatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green\nSleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; let\nthere come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.\nDivide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I will\nkeep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow\nof this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands.\nAm I a woodman, ha?

It is a good divine that\nfollows his own instructions: I can easier teach\ntwenty what were good to be done, than be one of the\ntwenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may\ndevise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps\no'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the\nyouth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the\ncripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to\nchoose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may\nneither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I\ndislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed\nby the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,\nNerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?\nI pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest\nthem, I will describe them; and, according to my\ndescription, level at my affection.\nAy, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but\ntalk of his horse; and he makes it a great\nappropriation to his own good parts, that he can\nshoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his\nmother played false with a smith.\nHe doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you\nwill not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and\nsmiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping\nphilosopher when he grows old, being so full of\nunmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be\nmarried to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth\nthan to either of these. God defend me from these\ntwo!\nGod made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.\nIn truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,\nhe! why, he hath a horse better than the\nNeapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than\nthe Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a\nthrostle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will\nfence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I\nshould marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me\nI would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I\nshall never requite him.\nYou know I say nothing to him, for he understands\nnot me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,\nnor Italian, and you will come into the court and\nswear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.\nHe is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can\nconverse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!\nI think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round\nhose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his\nbehavior every where.\nThat he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he\nborrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and\nswore he would pay him again when he was able: I\nthink the Frenchman became his surety and sealed\nunder for another.\nVery vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and\nmost vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when\nhe is best, he is a little worse than a man, and\nwhen he is worst, he is little better than a beast:\nand the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall\nmake shift to go without him.\nTherefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a\ndeep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,\nfor if the devil be within and that temptation\nwithout, I know he will choose it.

Take this same letter,\nAnd use thou all the endeavour of a man\nIn speed to Padua: see thou render this\nInto my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;\nAnd, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,\nBring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed\nUnto the tranect, to the common ferry\nWhich trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,\nBut get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.\nCome on, Nerissa; I have work in hand\nThat you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands\nBefore they think of us.\nThey shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,\nThat they shall think we are accomplished\nWith that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,\nWhen we are both accoutred like young men,\nI'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,\nAnd wear my dagger with the braver grace,\nAnd speak between the change of man and boy\nWith a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps\nInto a manly stride, and speak of frays\nLike a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,\nHow honourable ladies sought my love,\nWhich I denying, they fell sick and died;\nI could not do withal; then I'll repent,\nAnd wish for all that, that I had not killed them;\nAnd twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,\nThat men shall swear I have discontinued school\nAbove a twelvemonth. I have within my mind\nA thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,\nWhich I will practise.\nFie, what a question's that,\nIf thou wert near a lewd interpreter!\nBut come, I'll tell thee all my whole device\nWhen I am in my coach, which stays for us\nAt the park gate; and therefore haste away,\nFor we must measure twenty miles to-day.\nI did, my lord.\nI am informed thoroughly of the cause.\nWhich is the merchant here, and which the Jew?\nIs your name Shylock?\nOf a strange nature is the suit you follow;\nYet in such rule that the Venetian law\nCannot impugn you as you do proceed.\nYou stand within his danger, do you not?\nDo you confess the bond?\nThen must the Jew be merciful.\nThe quality of mercy is not strain'd,\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\nUpon the place beneath: it is twice blest;\nIt blesseth him that gives and him that takes:\n'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes\nThe throned monarch better than his crown;\nHis sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\nThe attribute to awe and majesty,\nWherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\nBut mercy is above this sceptred sway;\nIt is enthroned in the hearts of kings,\nIt is an attribute to God himself;\nAnd earthly power doth then show likest God's\nWhen mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\nThough justice be thy plea, consider this,\nThat, in the course of justice, none of us\nShould see salvation: we do pray for mercy;\nAnd that same prayer doth teach us all to render\nThe deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much\nTo mitigate the justice of thy plea;\nWhich if thou follow, this strict court of Venice\nMust needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.\nIs he not able to discharge the money?\nIt must not be; there is no power in Venice\nCan alter a decree established:\n'Twill be recorded for a precedent,\nAnd many an error by the same example\nWill rush into the state: it cannot be.\nI pray you, let me look upon the bond.\nShylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.\nWhy, this bond is forfeit;\nAnd lawfully by this the Jew may claim\nA pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\nNearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:\nTake thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.\nWhy then, thus it is:\nYou must prepare your bosom for his knife.\nFor the intent and purpose of the law\nHath full relation to the penalty,\nWhich here appeareth due upon the bond.\nTherefore lay bare your bosom.\nIt is so. Are there balance here to weigh\nThe flesh?\nHave by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,\nTo stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.\nIt is not so express'd: but what of that?\n'Twere good you do so much for charity.\nYou, merchant, have you any thing to say?\nYour wife would give you little thanks for that,\nIf she were by, to hear you make the offer.\nA pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:\nThe court awards it, and the law doth give it.\nAnd you must cut this flesh from off his breast:\nThe law allows it, and the court awards it.\nTarry a little; there is something else.\nThis bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;\nThe words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'\nTake then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;\nBut, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed\nOne drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods\nAre, by the laws of Venice, confiscate\nUnto the state of Venice.\nThyself shalt see the act:\nFor, as thou urgest justice, be assured\nThou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.\nSoft!\nThe Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:\nHe shall have nothing but the penalty.\nTherefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.\nShed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more\nBut just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more\nOr less than a just pound, be it but so much\nAs makes it light or heavy in the substance,\nOr the division of the twentieth part\nOf one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn\nBut in the estimation of a hair,\nThou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.\nWhy doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.\nHe hath refused it in the open court:\nHe shall have merely justice and his bond.\nThou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,\nTo be so taken at thy peril, Jew.\nTarry, Jew:\nThe law hath yet another hold on you.\nIt is enacted in the laws of Venice,\nIf it be proved against an alien\nThat by direct or indirect attempts\nHe seek the life of any citizen,\nThe party 'gainst the which he doth contrive\nShall seize one half his goods; the other half\nComes to the privy coffer of the state;\nAnd the offender's life lies in the mercy\nOf the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.\nIn which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;\nFor it appears, by manifest proceeding,\nThat indirectly and directly too\nThou hast contrived against the very life\nOf the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd\nThe danger formerly by me rehearsed.\nDown therefore and beg mercy of the duke.\nAy, for the state, not for Antonio.\nWhat mercy can you render him, Antonio?\nArt thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?\nClerk, draw a deed of gift.\nI humbly do desire your grace of pardon:\nI must away this night toward Padua,\nAnd it is meet I presently set forth.\nHe is well paid that is well satisfied;\nAnd I, delivering you, am satisfied\nAnd therein do account myself well paid:\nMy mind was never yet more mercenary.\nI pray you, know me when we meet again:\nI wish you well, and so I take my leave.\nYou press me far, and therefore I will yield.\nGive me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;\nAnd, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:\nDo not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;\nAnd you in love shall not deny me this.\nI will have nothing else but only this;\nAnd now methinks I have a mind to it.\nI see, sir, you are liberal in offers\nYou taught me first to beg; and now methinks\nYou teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.\nThat 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.\nAn if your wife be not a mad-woman,\nAnd know how well I have deserved the ring,\nShe would not hold out enemy for ever,\nFor giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!\nInquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed\nAnd let him sign it: we'll away to-night\nAnd be a day before our husbands home:\nThis deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.\nThat cannot be:\nHis ring I do accept most thankfully:\nAnd so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,\nI pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.\nThou mayst, I warrant.\nWe shall have old swearing\nThat they did give the rings away to men;\nBut we'll outface them, and outswear them too.\nAway! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.\nThat light we see is burning in my hall.\nHow far that little candle throws his beams!\nSo shines a good deed in a naughty world.\nSo doth the greater glory dim the less:\nA substitute shines brightly as a king\nUnto the king be by, and then his state\nEmpties itself, as doth an inland brook\nInto the main of waters. Music! hark!\nNothing is good, I see, without respect:\nMethinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.\nThe crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,\nWhen neither is attended, and I think\nThe nightingale, if she should sing by day,\nWhen every goose is cackling, would be thought\nNo better a musician than the wren.\nHow many things by season season'd are\nTo their right praise and true perfection!\nPeace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion\nAnd would not be awaked.\nHe knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,\nBy the bad voice.\nWe have been praying for our husbands' healths,\nWhich speed, we hope, the better for our words.\nAre they return'd?\nGo in, Nerissa;\nGive order to my servants that they take\nNo note at all of our being absent hence;\nNor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.\nThis night methinks is but the daylight sick;\nIt looks a little paler: 'tis a day,\nSuch as the day is when the sun is hid.\nLet me give light, but let me not be light;\nFor a light wife doth make a heavy husband,\nAnd never be Bassanio so for me:\nBut God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.\nYou should in all sense be much bound to him.\nFor, as I hear, he was much bound for you.\nSir, you are very welcome to our house:\nIt must appear in other ways than words,\nTherefore I scant this breathing courtesy.\nA quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?\nYou were to blame, I must be plain with you,\nTo part so slightly with your wife's first gift:\nA thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger\nAnd so riveted with faith unto your flesh.\nI gave my love a ring and made him swear\nNever to part with it; and here he stands;\nI dare be sworn for him he would not leave it\nNor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth\nThat the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,\nYou give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:\nAn 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.\nWhat ring gave you my lord?\nNot that, I hope, which you received of me.\nEven so void is your false heart of truth.\nBy heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed\nUntil I see the ring.\nIf you had known the virtue of the ring,\nOr half her worthiness that gave the ring,\nOr your own honour to contain the ring,\nYou would not then have parted with the ring.\nWhat man is there so much unreasonable,\nIf you had pleased to have defended it\nWith any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty\nTo urge the thing held as a ceremony?\nNerissa teaches me what to believe:\nI'll die for't but some woman had the ring.\nLet not that doctor e'er come near my house:\nSince he hath got the jewel that I loved,\nAnd that which you did swear to keep for me,\nI will become as liberal as you;\nI'll not deny him any thing I have,\nNo, not my body nor my husband's bed:\nKnow him I shall, I am well sure of it:\nLie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:\nIf you do not, if I be left alone,\nNow, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,\nI'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.\nSir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.\nMark you but that!\nIn both my eyes he doubly sees himself;\nIn each eye, one: swear by your double self,\nAnd there's an oath of credit.\nThen you shall be his surety. Give him this\nAnd bid him keep it better than the other.\nI had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;\nFor, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.\nSpeak not so grossly.

Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his\nown getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest\ndeer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore\nblessed? No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village, so\nis the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare\nbrow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no\nskill, by so much is horn more precious than to want. Here comes\nSir Oliver.\nSir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch us here\nunder this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?\nI will not take her on gift of any man.\nGood even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?\nYou are very well met. Goddild you for your last company. I am\nvery glad to see you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay; pray be\ncover'd.\nAs the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and\nthe falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons\nbill, so wedlock would be nibbling.\nI am not in the mind but I were better to be\nmarried of him than of another; for he is not like to marry me\nwell; and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me\nhereafter to leave my wife.\nCome, sweet Audrey;\nWe must be married or we must live in bawdry.\nFarewell, good Master Oliver. Not-\nO sweet Oliver,\nO brave Oliver,\nLeave me not behind thee.\nBut-\nWind away,\nBegone, I say,\nI will not to wedding with thee.\nWe shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.\nA most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.\nBut, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to\nyou.\nIt is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth,\nwe that have good wits have much to answer for: we shall be\nflouting; we cannot hold.\nGood ev'n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy\nhead; nay, prithee be cover'd. How old are you, friend?\nA ripe age. Is thy name William?\nA fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?\n'Thank God.' A good answer.\nArt rich?\n'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and\nyet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?\nWhy, thou say'st well. I do now remember a saying: 'The\nfool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be\na fool.' The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a\ngrape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning\nthereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do\nlove this maid?\nGive me your hand. Art thou learned?\nThen learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a\nfigure in rhetoric that drink, being pour'd out of cup into a\nglass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your\nwriters do consent that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse, for I\nam he.\nHe, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you\nclown, abandon- which is in the vulgar leave- the society- which\nin the boorish is company- of this female- which in the common is\nwoman- which together is: abandon the society of this female; or,\nclown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest;\nor, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into\ndeath, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee,\nor in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction;\nwill o'er-run thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred and\nfifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.\nTrip, Audrey, trip, Audrey. I attend, I attend.\nTo-morrow is the joyful day, Audrey; to-morrow will we\nbe married.\nBy my troth, well met. Come sit, sit, and a song.\nTruly, young gentlemen, though there was no great\nmatter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.\nBy my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear such\na foolish song. God buy you; and God mend your voices. Come,\nAudrey. \nSalutation and greeting to you all!\nIf any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.\nI have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been\npolitic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone\nthree tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought\none.\nFaith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the\nseventh cause.\nGod 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in\nhere, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear\nand to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A\npoor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a\npoor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will. Rich\nhonesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl\nin your foul oyster.\nAccording to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet\ndiseases.\nUpon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more\nseeming, Audrey- as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain\ncourtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was not\ncut well, he was in the mind it was. This is call'd the Retort\nCourteous. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would\nsend me word he cut it to please himself. This is call'd the Quip\nModest. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment.\nThis is call'd the Reply Churlish. If again it was not well cut,\nhe would answer I spake not true. This is call'd the Reproof\nValiant. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This\nis call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome. And so to the Lie\nCircumstantial and the Lie Direct.\nI durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor\nhe durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords\nand parted.\nO, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have\nbooks for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first,\nthe Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the\nReply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the\nCountercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance;\nthe seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie\nDirect; and you may avoid that too with an If. I knew when seven\njustices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were\nmet themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as: 'If you\nsaid so, then I said so.' And they shook hands, and swore\nbrothers. Your If is the only peace-maker; much virtue in If.\n", 'M'), ("My ladies both, good day to you.\nHow do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.\nWhat are you sewing here?

I will maintain\nMy truth and honour firmly.\nA herald, ho, a herald!\nSound! First trumpet.\nHimself. What say'st thou to him?\nIn wisdom I should ask thy name;\nBut since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,\nAnd that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,\nWhat safe and nicely I might well delay\nBy rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.\nBack do I toss those treasons to thy head;\nWith the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;\nWhich- for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise-\nThis sword of mine shall give them instant way\nWhere they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!\nWhat, you have charg'd me with, that have I done,\nAnd more, much more. The time will bring it out.\n'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou\nThat hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,\nI do forgive thee.\nTh' hast spoken right; 'tis true.\nThe wheel is come full circle; I am here.\nThis speech of yours hath mov'd me,\nAnd shall perchance do good; but speak you on;\nYou look as you had something more to say.\nI was contracted to them both.

What years, i' faith?\nToo old by heaven: let still the woman take\nAn elder than herself: so wears she to him,\nSo sways she level in her husband's heart:\nFor, boy, however we do praise ourselves,\nOur fancies are more giddy and unfirm,\nMore longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,\nThan women's are.\nThen let thy love be younger than thyself,\nOr thy affection cannot hold the bent;\nFor women are as roses, whose fair flower\nBeing once display'd, doth fall that very hour.\nO, fellow, come, the song we had last night.\nMark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;\nThe spinsters and the knitters in the sun\nAnd the free maids that weave their thread with bones\nDo use to chant it: it is silly sooth,\nAnd dallies with the innocence of love,\nLike the old age.\nAy; prithee, sing.\nThere's for thy pains.\nI'll pay thy pleasure then.\nGive me now leave to leave thee.\nLet all the rest give place.\nOnce more, Cesario,\nGet thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:\nTell her, my love, more noble than the world,\nPrizes not quantity of dirty lands;\nThe parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,\nTell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;\nBut 'tis that miracle and queen of gems\nThat nature pranks her in attracts my soul.\nI cannot be so answer'd.\nThere is no woman's sides\nCan bide the beating of so strong a passion\nAs love doth give my heart; no woman's heart\nSo big, to hold so much; they lack retention\nAlas, their love may be call'd appetite,\nNo motion of the liver, but the palate,\nThat suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;\nBut mine is all as hungry as the sea,\nAnd can digest as much: make no compare\nBetween that love a woman can bear me\nAnd that I owe Olivia.\nWhat dost thou know?\nAnd what's her history?\nBut died thy sister of her love, my boy?\nAy, that's the theme.\nTo her in haste; give her this jewel; say,\nMy love can give no place, bide no denay.\nBelong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?\nI know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?\nJust the contrary; the better for thy friends.\nHow can that be?\nWhy, this is excellent.\nThou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.\nO, you give me ill counsel.\nWell, I will be so much a sinner, to be a\ndouble-dealer: there's another.\nYou can fool no more money out of me at this throw:\nif you will let your lady know I am here to speak\nwith her, and bring her along with you, it may awake\nmy bounty further.\nThat face of his I do remember well;\nYet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd\nAs black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:\nA bawbling vessel was he captain of,\nFor shallow draught and bulk unprizable;\nWith which such scathful grapple did he make\nWith the most noble bottom of our fleet,\nThat very envy and the tongue of loss\nCried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?\nNotable pirate! thou salt-water thief!\nWhat foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,\nWhom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,\nHast made thine enemies?\nWhen came he to this town?\nHere comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.\nBut for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:\nThree months this youth hath tended upon me;\nBut more of that anon. Take him aside.\nGracious Olivia,\xe2\x80\x94\nStill so cruel?\nWhat, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,\nTo whose ingrate and unauspicious altars\nMy soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out\nThat e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?\nWhy should I not, had I the heart to do it,\nLike to the Egyptian thief at point of death,\nKill what I love?\xe2\x80\x94a savage jealousy\nThat sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:\nSince you to non-regardance cast my faith,\nAnd that I partly know the instrument\nThat screws me from my true place in your favour,\nLive you the marble-breasted tyrant still;\nBut this your minion, whom I know you love,\nAnd whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,\nHim will I tear out of that cruel eye,\nWhere he sits crowned in his master's spite.\nCome, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:\nI'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,\nTo spite a raven's heart within a dove.\nCome, away!\nHusband!\nHer husband, sirrah!\nO thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be\nWhen time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?\nOr will not else thy craft so quickly grow,\nThat thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?\nFarewell, and take her; but direct thy feet\nWhere thou and I henceforth may never meet.\nMy gentleman, Cesario?\nHow now, gentleman! how is't with you?\nOne face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,\nA natural perspective, that is and is not!\nBe not amazed; right noble is his blood.\nIf this be so, as yet the glass seems true,\nI shall have share in this most happy wreck.\nBoy, thou hast said to me a thousand times\nThou never shouldst love woman like to me.\nGive me thy hand;\nAnd let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.\nThis savours not much of distraction.\nMadam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.\nYour master quits you; and for your service done him,\nSo much against the mettle of your sex,\nSo far beneath your soft and tender breeding,\nAnd since you call'd me master for so long,\nHere is my hand: you shall from this time be\nYour master's mistress.\nIs this the madman?\nPursue him and entreat him to a peace:\nHe hath not told us of the captain yet:\nWhen that is known and golden time convents,\nA solemn combination shall be made\nOf our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,\nWe will not part from hence.

Stand;\nOr we are Romans and will give you that\nLike beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,\nBut to look back in frown: stand, stand.'\nThese three,\nThree thousand confident, in act as many\xe2\x80\x94\nFor three performers are the file when all\nThe rest do nothing\xe2\x80\x94with this word 'Stand, stand,'\nAccommodated by the place, more charming\nWith their own nobleness, which could have turn'd\nA distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,\nPart shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,\nturn'd coward\nBut by example\xe2\x80\x94O, a sin in war,\nDamn'd in the first beginners!\xe2\x80\x94gan to look\nThe way that they did, and to grin like lions\nUpon the pikes o' the hunters.

Well, I will find him\nFor being now a favourer to the Briton,\nNo more a Briton, I have resumed again\nThe part I came in: fight I will no more,\nBut yield me to the veriest hind that shall\nOnce touch my shoulder.

Heaven keep your honour!\nUnder your sentence?\nWhen, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,\nLonger or shorter, he may be so fitted\nThat his soul sicken not.\n'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.\nSir, believe this,\nI had rather give my body than my soul.\nHow say you?\nPlease you to do't,\nI'll take it as a peril to my soul,\nIt is no sin at all, but charity.\nThat I do beg his life, if it be sin,\nHeaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,\nIf that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer\nTo have it added to the faults of mine,\nAnd nothing of your answer.\nLet me be ignorant, and in nothing good,\nBut graciously to know I am no better.\nSo.\nTrue.\nAs much for my poor brother as myself:\nThat is, were I under the terms of death,\nThe impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,\nAnd strip myself to death, as to a bed\nThat longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield\nMy body up to shame.\nAnd 'twere the cheaper way:\nBetter it were a brother died at once,\nThan that a sister, by redeeming him,\nShould die for ever.\nIgnomy in ransom and free pardon\nAre of two houses: lawful mercy\nIs nothing kin to foul redemption.\nO, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,\nTo have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:\nI something do excuse the thing I hate,\nFor his advantage that I dearly love.\nElse let my brother die,\nIf not a feodary, but only he\nOwe and succeed thy weakness.\nAy, as the glasses where they view themselves;\nWhich are as easy broke as they make forms.\nWomen! Help Heaven! men their creation mar\nIn profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;\nFor we are soft as our complexions are,\nAnd credulous to false prints.\nI have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,\nLet me entreat you speak the former language.\nMy brother did love Juliet,\nAnd you tell me that he shall die for it.\nI know your virtue hath a licence in't,\nWhich seems a little fouler than it is,\nTo pluck on others.\nHa! little honour to be much believed,\nAnd most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!\nI will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:\nSign me a present pardon for my brother,\nOr with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud\nWhat man thou art.\nTo whom should I complain? Did I tell this,\nWho would believe me? O perilous mouths,\nThat bear in them one and the self-same tongue,\nEither of condemnation or approof;\nBidding the law make court'sy to their will:\nHooking both right and wrong to the appetite,\nTo follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:\nThough he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,\nYet hath he in him such a mind of honour.\nThat, had he twenty heads to tender down\nOn twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,\nBefore his sister should her body stoop\nTo such abhorr'd pollution.\nThen, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:\nMore than our brother is our chastity.\nI'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,\nAnd fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.\nWhat, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!\nMy business is a word or two with Claudio.\nWhy,\nAs all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.\nLord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,\nIntends you for his swift ambassador,\nWhere you shall be an everlasting leiger:\nTherefore your best appointment make with speed;\nTo-morrow you set on.\nNone, but such remedy as, to save a head,\nTo cleave a heart in twain.\nYes, brother, you may live:\nThere is a devilish mercy in the judge,\nIf you'll implore it, that will free your life,\nBut fetter you till death.\nAy, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,\nThough all the world's vastidity you had,\nTo a determined scope.\nIn such a one as, you consenting to't,\nWould bark your honour from that trunk you bear,\nAnd leave you naked.\nO, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,\nLest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,\nAnd six or seven winters more respect\nThan a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?\nThe sense of death is most in apprehension;\nAnd the poor beetle, that we tread upon,\nIn corporal sufferance finds a pang as great\nAs when a giant dies.\nThere spake my brother; there my father's grave\nDid utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:\nThou art too noble to conserve a life\nIn base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,\nWhose settled visage and deliberate word\nNips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew\nAs falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil\nHis filth within being cast, he would appear\nA pond as deep as hell.\nO, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,\nThe damned'st body to invest and cover\nIn prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?\nIf I would yield him my virginity,\nThou mightst be freed.\nYes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,\nSo to offend him still. This night's the time\nThat I should do what I abhor to name,\nOr else thou diest to-morrow.\nO, were it but my life,\nI'ld throw it down for your deliverance\nAs frankly as a pin.\nBe ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.\nWhich is the least?\nWhat says my brother?\nAnd shamed life a hateful.\nAlas, alas!\nO you beast!\nO faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!\nWilt thou be made a man out of my vice?\nIs't not a kind of incest, to take life\nFrom thine own sister's shame? What should I think?\nHeaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!\nFor such a warped slip of wilderness\nNe'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!\nDie, perish! Might but my bending down\nReprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:\nI'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,\nNo word to save thee.\nO, fie, fie, fie!\nThy sin's not accidental, but a trade.\nMercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:\n'Tis best thou diest quickly.\nWhat is your will?\nI have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be\nstolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.\nI am now going to resolve him: I had rather my\nbrother die by the law than my son should be\nunlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke\ndeceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can\nspeak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or\ndiscover his government.\nLet me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do\nanything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.\nI have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.\nCan this be so? did Angelo so leave her?\nWhat a merit were it in death to take this poor maid\nfrom the world! What corruption in this life, that\nit will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?\nShow me how, good father.\nThe image of it gives me content already; and I\ntrust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.\nI thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.\nHe hath a garden circummured with brick,\nWhose western side is with a vineyard back'd;\nAnd to that vineyard is a planched gate,\nThat makes his opening with this bigger key:\nThis other doth command a little door\nWhich from the vineyard to the garden leads;\nThere have I made my promise\nUpon the heavy middle of the night\nTo call upon him.\nI have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:\nWith whispering and most guilty diligence,\nIn action all of precept, he did show me\nThe way twice o'er.\nNo, none, but only a repair i' the dark;\nAnd that I have possess'd him my most stay\nCan be but brief; for I have made him know\nI have a servant comes with me along,\nThat stays upon me, whose persuasion is\nI come about my brother.\nI do desire the like.\nShe'll take the enterprise upon her, father,\nIf you advise it.\nLittle have you to say\nWhen you depart from him, but, soft and low,\n'Remember now my brother.'\nPeace, ho, be here!\nHo, by your leave!\nThe better, given me by so holy a man.\nHath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?\nNay, but it is not so.\nO, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!\nUnhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!\nInjurious world! most damned Angelo!\nI am directed by you.\nTo speak so indirectly I am loath:\nI would say the truth; but to accuse him so,\nThat is your part: yet I am advised to do it;\nHe says, to veil full purpose.\nBesides, he tells me that, if peradventure\nHe speak against me on the adverse side,\nI should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic\nThat's bitter to sweet end.\nO, peace! the friar is come.\nJustice, O royal duke!

Hear me, O hear me, here!\nBy course of justice!\nMost strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:\nThat Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?\nThat Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?\nThat Angelo is an adulterous thief,\nAn hypocrite, a virgin-violator;\nIs it not strange and strange?\nIt is not truer he is Angelo\nThan this is all as true as it is strange:\nNay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth\nTo the end of reckoning.\nO prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest\nThere is another comfort than this world,\nThat thou neglect me not, with that opinion\nThat I am touch'd with madness!

It suffices me thou\nart. Look you, who comes here?\nHere is such patchery, such juggling and such\nknavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a\nwhore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions\nand bleed to death upon.

What music will be in\nhim when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know\nnot; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo\nget his sinews to make catlings on.\nLet me bear another to his horse; for that's the more\ncapable creature.\nWould the fountain of your mind were clear again,\nthat I might water an ass at it!

Now, the rotten diseases\nof the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs,\nloads o' gravel i' the back, lethargies, cold\npalsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing\nlungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas,\nlimekilns i' the palm, incurable bone-ache, and the\nrivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take\nagain such preposterous discoveries!\nDo I curse thee?\nNo! why art thou then exasperate, thou idle\nimmaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarcenet\nflap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's\npurse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered\nwith such waterflies, diminutives of nature!\nFinch-egg!\nWith too much blood and too little brain, these two\nmay run mad; but, if with too much brain and too\nlittle blood they do, I'll be a curer of madmen.\nHere's Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough and one\nthat loves quails; but he has not so much brain as\nearwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiter\nthere, his brother, the bull,\xe2\x80\x94the primitive statue,\nand oblique memorial of cuckolds; a thrifty\nshoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother's\nleg,\xe2\x80\x94to what form but that he is, should wit larded\nwith malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?\nTo an ass, were nothing; he is both ass and ox: to\nan ox, were nothing; he is both ox and ass. To be a\ndog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an\nowl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would\nnot care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire\nagainst destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if I\nwere not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse\nof a lazar, so I were not Menelaus! Hey-day!\nspirits and fires!\nSweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink,\nsweet sewer.\nThat same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a most\nunjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers\nthan I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend\nhis mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound:\nbut when he performs, astronomers foretell it; it\nis prodigious, there will come some change; the sun\nborrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his\nword. I will rather leave to see Hector, than\nnot to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan\ndrab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll\nafter. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!\nAnd any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff;\nshe's noted.\nRoguery!\nA juggling trick,\xe2\x80\x94to be secretly open.\nHow the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and\npotato-finger, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry!\nNow the pledge; now, now, now!\nNow she sharpens: well said, whetstone!\nNor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases me best.\nA proof of strength she could not publish more,\nUnless she said ' My mind is now turn'd whore.'\nWill he swagger himself out on's own eyes?\nHe'll tickle it for his concupy.\nWould I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would\ncroak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode.\nPatroclus will give me any thing for the\nintelligence of this whore: the parrot will not\ndo more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.\nLechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery; nothing\nelse holds fashion: a burning devil take them!\nNow they are clapper-clawing one another; I'll go\nlook on. That dissembling abominable varlets Diomed,\nhas got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's\nsleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain see\nthem meet; that that same young Trojan ass, that\nloves the whore there, might send that Greekish\nwhore-masterly villain, with the sleeve, back to the\ndissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless errand.\nO' the t'other side, the policy of those crafty\nswearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry\ncheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is\nnot proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up, in\npolicy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog of\nas bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax\nprouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm\nto-day; whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim\nbarbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion.\nSoft! here comes sleeve, and t'other.\nHold thy whore, Grecian!\xe2\x80\x94now for thy whore,\nTrojan!\xe2\x80\x94now the sleeve, now the sleeve!\nNo, no, I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave:\na very filthy rogue.\nGod-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me; but a\nplague break thy neck for frightening me!

As for my wife,\nI would you had her spirit in such another:\nThe third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle\nYou may pace easy, but not such a wife.\nSo much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar\nMade out of her impatience, which not wanted\nShrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant\nDid you too much disquiet: for that you must\nBut say, I could not help it.\nSir,\nHe fell upon me ere admitted: then\nThree kings I had newly feasted, and did want\nOf what I was i' the morning: but next day\nI told him of myself; which was as much\nAs to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow\nBe nothing of our strife; if we contend,\nOut of our question wipe him.\nNo,\nLepidus, let him speak:\nThe honour is sacred which he talks on now,\nSupposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;\nThe article of my oath.\nNeglected, rather;\nAnd then when poison'd hours had bound me up\nFrom mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,\nI'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty\nShall not make poor my greatness, nor my power\nWork without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,\nTo have me out of Egypt, made wars here;\nFor which myself, the ignorant motive, do\nSo far ask pardon as befits mine honour\nTo stoop in such a case.\nThou art a soldier only: speak no more.\nYou wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.\nI am not married, Caesar: let me hear\nAgrippa further speak.\nWill Caesar speak?\nWhat power is in Agrippa,\nIf I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'\nTo make this good?\nMay I never\nTo this good purpose, that so fairly shows,\nDream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:\nFurther this act of grace: and from this hour\nThe heart of brothers govern in our loves\nAnd sway our great designs!\nI did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;\nFor he hath laid strange courtesies and great\nOf late upon me: I must thank him only,\nLest my remembrance suffer ill report;\nAt heel of that, defy him.\nWhere lies he?\nWhat is his strength by land?\nSo is the fame.\nWould we had spoke together! Haste we for it:\nYet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we\nThe business we have talk'd of.\nLet us, Lepidus,\nNot lack your company.\nThe world and my great office will sometimes\nDivide me from your bosom.\nGood night, sir. My Octavia,\nRead not my blemishes in the world's report:\nI have not kept my square; but that to come\nShall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady.\nGood night, sir.\nNow, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?\nIf you can, your reason?\nSay to me,\nWhose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?\nSpeak this no more.\nGet thee gone:\nSay to Ventidius I would speak with him:\nHe shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,\nHe hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;\nAnd in our sports my better cunning faints\nUnder his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;\nHis cocks do win the battle still of mine,\nWhen it is all to nought; and his quails ever\nBeat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt:\nAnd though I make this marriage for my peace,\nI' the east my pleasure lies.\nO, come, Ventidius,\nYou must to Parthia: your commission's ready;\nFollow me, and receive't.\nThou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;\nWe'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st\nHow much we do o'er-count thee.\nWhich do not be entreated to, but weigh\nWhat it is worth embraced.\nI have heard it, Pompey;\nAnd am well studied for a liberal thanks\nWhich I do owe you.\nThe beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,\nThat call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;\nFor I have gain'd by 't.\nThat will I, Pompey.\nYou have heard much.\nAnd fair words to them.\nThus do they, sir: they take\nthe flow o' the Nile\nBy certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,\nBy the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth\nOr foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,\nThe more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman\nUpon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,\nAnd shortly comes to harvest.\nAy, Lepidus.\nThey are so.\nIt is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad\nas it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,\nand moves with its own organs: it lives by that\nwhich nourisheth it; and the elements once out of\nit, it transmigrates.\nOf it own colour too.\n'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.\nWith the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a\nvery epicure.\nThese quick-sands, Lepidus,\nKeep off them, for you sink.\nBear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.\nIt ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?\nHere is to Caesar!\nBe a child o' the time.\nCome, let's all take hands,\nTill that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense\nIn soft and delicate Lethe.\nAnd shall, sir; give's your hand.\nNo further, sir.\nMake me not offended\nIn your distrust.\nYou shall not find,\nThough you be therein curious, the least cause\nFor what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,\nAnd make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!\nWe will here part.\nThe April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,\nAnd these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.\nHer tongue will not obey her heart, nor can\nHer heart inform her tongue,\xe2\x80\x94the swan's\ndown-feather,\nThat stands upon the swell at full of tide,\nAnd neither way inclines.\nCome, sir, come;\nI'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:\nLook, here I have you; thus I let you go,\nAnd give you to the gods.\nFarewell!\nNay, nay, Octavia, not only that,\xe2\x80\x94\nThat were excusable, that, and thousands more\nOf semblable import,\xe2\x80\x94but he hath waged\nNew wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it\nTo public ear:\nSpoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not\nBut pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly\nHe vented them; most narrow measure lent me:\nWhen the best hint was given him, he not took't,\nOr did it from his teeth.\nGentle Octavia,\nLet your best love draw to that point, which seeks\nBest to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,\nI lose myself: better I were not yours\nThan yours so branchless. But, as you requested,\nYourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,\nI'll raise the preparation of a war\nShall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;\nSo your desires are yours.\nWhen it appears to you where this begins,\nTurn your displeasure that way: for our faults\nCan never be so equal, that your love\nCan equally move with them. Provide your going;\nChoose your own company, and command what cost\nYour heart has mind to.\nIs it not strange, Canidius,\nThat from Tarentum and Brundusium\nHe could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,\nAnd take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?\nA good rebuke,\nWhich might have well becomed the best of men,\nTo taunt at slackness. Canidius, we\nWill fight with him by sea.\nFor that he dares us to't.\nBy sea, by sea.\nI'll fight at sea.\nOur overplus of shipping will we burn;\nAnd, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium\nBeat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,\nWe then can do't at land.\nThy business?\nCan he be there in person? 'tis impossible;\nStrange that power should be. Canidius,\nOur nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,\nAnd our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:\nAway, my Thetis!\nHow now, worthy soldier?\nWell, well: away!\nSet we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill,\nIn eye of Caesar's battle; from which place\nWe may the number of the ships behold,\nAnd so proceed accordingly.\nHark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;\nIt is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:\nI am so lated in the world, that I\nHave lost my way for ever: I have a ship\nLaden with gold; take that, divide it; fly,\nAnd make your peace with Caesar.\nI have fled myself; and have instructed cowards\nTo run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;\nI have myself resolved upon a course\nWhich has no need of you; be gone:\nMy treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,\nI follow'd that I blush to look upon:\nMy very hairs do mutiny; for the white\nReprove the brown for rashness, and they them\nFor fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall\nHave letters from me to some friends that will\nSweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,\nNor make replies of loathness: take the hint\nWhich my despair proclaims; let that be left\nWhich leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:\nI will possess you of that ship and treasure.\nLeave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:\nNay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,\nTherefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by.\nNo, no, no, no, no.\nO fie, fie, fie!\nYes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept\nHis sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck\nThe lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I\nThat the mad Brutus ended: he alone\nDealt on lieutenantry, and no practise had\nIn the brave squares of war: yet now\xe2\x80\x94No matter.\nI have offended reputation,\nA most unnoble swerving.\nO, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,\nHow I convey my shame out of thine eyes\nBy looking back what I have left behind\n'Stroy'd in dishonour.\nEgypt, thou knew'st too well\nMy heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,\nAnd thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit\nThy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that\nThy beck might from the bidding of the gods\nCommand me.\nNow I must\nTo the young man send humble treaties, dodge\nAnd palter in the shifts of lowness; who\nWith half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,\nMaking and marring fortunes. You did know\nHow much you were my conqueror; and that\nMy sword, made weak by my affection, would\nObey it on all cause.\nFall not a tear, I say; one of them rates\nAll that is won and lost: give me a kiss;\nEven this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;\nIs he come back? Love, I am full of lead.\nSome wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows\nWe scorn her most when most she offers blows.\nIs that his answer?\nThe queen shall then have courtesy, so she\nWill yield us up.\nLet her know't.\nTo the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,\nAnd he will fill thy wishes to the brim\nWith principalities.\nTo him again: tell him he wears the rose\nOf youth upon him; from which the world should note\nSomething particular: his coin, ships, legions,\nMay be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail\nUnder the service of a child as soon\nAs i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore\nTo lay his gay comparisons apart,\nAnd answer me declined, sword against sword,\nOurselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.\nFavours, by Jove that thunders!\nWhat art thou, fellow?\nApproach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods\nand devils!\nAuthority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'\nLike boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,\nAnd cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am\nAntony yet.\nTake hence this Jack, and whip him.\nMoon and stars!\nWhip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries\nThat do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them\nSo saucy with the hand of she here,\xe2\x80\x94what's her name,\nSince she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,\nTill, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,\nAnd whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.\nTug him away: being whipp'd,\nBring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall\nBear us an errand to him.\nYou were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!\nHave I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,\nForborne the getting of a lawful race,\nAnd by a gem of women, to be abused\nBy one that looks on feeders?\nYou have been a boggler ever:\nBut when we in our viciousness grow hard\xe2\x80\x94\nO misery on't!\xe2\x80\x94the wise gods seel our eyes;\nIn our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us\nAdore our errors; laugh at's, while we strut\nTo our confusion.\nI found you as a morsel cold upon\nDead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment\nOf Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,\nUnregister'd in vulgar fame, you have\nLuxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,\nThough you can guess what temperance should be,\nYou know not what it is.\nTo let a fellow that will take rewards\nAnd say 'God quit you!' be familiar with\nMy playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal\nAnd plighter of high hearts! O, that I were\nUpon the hill of Basan, to outroar\nThe horned herd! for I have savage cause;\nAnd to proclaim it civilly, were like\nA halter'd neck which does the hangman thank\nFor being yare about him.\nIs he whipp'd?\nCried he? and begg'd a' pardon?\nIf that thy father live, let him repent\nThou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry\nTo follow Caesar in his triumph, since\nThou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth\nThe white hand of a lady fever thee,\nShake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,\nTell him thy entertainment: look, thou say\nHe makes me angry with him; for he seems\nProud and disdainful, harping on what I am,\nNot what he knew I was: he makes me angry;\nAnd at this time most easy 'tis to do't,\nWhen my good stars, that were my former guides,\nHave empty left their orbs, and shot their fires\nInto the abysm of hell. If he mislike\nMy speech and what is done, tell him he has\nHipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom\nHe may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,\nAs he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:\nHence with thy stripes, begone!\nAlack, our terrene moon\nIs now eclipsed; and it portends alone\nThe fall of Antony!\nTo flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes\nWith one that ties his points?\nCold-hearted toward me?\nI am satisfied.\nCaesar sits down in Alexandria; where\nI will oppose his fate. Our force by land\nHath nobly held; our sever'd navy too\nHave knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.\nWhere hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?\nIf from the field I shall return once more\nTo kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;\nI and my sword will earn our chronicle:\nThere's hope in't yet.\nI will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,\nAnd fight maliciously: for when mine hours\nWere nice and lucky, men did ransom lives\nOf me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,\nAnd send to darkness all that stop me. Come,\nLet's have one other gaudy night: call to me\nAll my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;\nLet's mock the midnight bell.\nWe will yet do well.\nDo so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force\nThe wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;\nThere's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,\nI'll make death love me; for I will contend\nEven with his pestilent scythe.\nHe will not fight with me, Domitius.\nWhy should he not?\nTo-morrow, soldier,\nBy sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,\nOr bathe my dying honour in the blood\nShall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?\nWell said; come on.\nCall forth my household servants: let's to-night\nBe bounteous at our meal.\nGive me thy hand,\nThou hast been rightly honest;\xe2\x80\x94so hast thou;\xe2\x80\x94\nThou,\xe2\x80\x94and thou,\xe2\x80\x94and thou:\xe2\x80\x94you have served me well,\nAnd kings have been your fellows.\nAnd thou art honest too.\nI wish I could be made so many men,\nAnd all of you clapp'd up together in\nAn Antony, that I might do you service\nSo good as you have done.\nWell, my good fellows, wait on me to-night:\nScant not my cups; and make as much of me\nAs when mine empire was your fellow too,\nAnd suffer'd my command.\nTend me to-night;\nMay be it is the period of your duty:\nHaply you shall not see me more; or if,\nA mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow\nYou'll serve another master. I look on you\nAs one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,\nI turn you not away; but, like a master\nMarried to your good service, stay till death:\nTend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,\nAnd the gods yield you for't!\nHo, ho, ho!\nNow the witch take me, if I meant it thus!\nGrace grow where those drops fall!\nMy hearty friends,\nYou take me in too dolorous a sense;\nFor I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you\nTo burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,\nI hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you\nWhere rather I'll expect victorious life\nThan death and honour. Let's to supper, come,\nAnd drown consideration.\nEros! mine armour, Eros!\nNo, my chuck. Eros, come; mine armour, Eros!\nCome good fellow, put mine iron on:\nIf fortune be not ours to-day, it is\nBecause we brave her: come.\nAh, let be, let be! thou art\nThe armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this.\nWell, well;\nWe shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?\nGo put on thy defences.\nRarely, rarely:\nHe that unbuckles this, till we do please\nTo daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.\nThou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire\nMore tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love,\nThat thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st\nThe royal occupation! thou shouldst see\nA workman in't.\nGood morrow to thee; welcome:\nThou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:\nTo business that we love we rise betime,\nAnd go to't with delight.\n'Tis well blown, lads:\nThis morning, like the spirit of a youth\nThat means to be of note, begins betimes.\nSo, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.\nFare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me:\nThis is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable\nAnd worthy shameful cheque it were, to stand\nOn more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee\nNow, like a man of steel. You that will fight,\nFollow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.\nWould thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd\nTo make me fight at land!\nWho's gone this morning?\nWhat say'st thou?\nIs he gone?\nGo, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;\nDetain no jot, I charge thee: write to him\xe2\x80\x94\nI will subscribe\xe2\x80\x94gentle adieus and greetings;\nSay that I wish he never find more cause\nTo change a master. O, my fortunes have\nCorrupted honest men! Dispatch.\xe2\x80\x94Enobarbus!\nThou bleed'st apace.\nThey do retire.\nI will reward thee\nOnce for thy spritely comfort, and ten-fold\nFor thy good valour. Come thee on.\nWe have beat him to his camp: run one before,\nAnd let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,\nBefore the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood\nThat has to-day escaped. I thank you all;\nFor doughty-handed are you, and have fought\nNot as you served the cause, but as 't had been\nEach man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.\nEnter the city, clip your wives, your friends,\nTell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears\nWash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss\nThe honour'd gashes whole.\nGive me thy hand\nTo this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,\nMake her thanks bless thee.\nO thou day o' the world,\nChain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all,\nThrough proof of harness to my heart, and there\nRide on the pants triumphing!\nMy nightingale,\nWe have beat them to their beds. What, girl!\nthough grey\nDo something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we\nA brain that nourishes our nerves, and can\nGet goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;\nCommend unto his lips thy favouring hand:\nKiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day\nAs if a god, in hate of mankind, had\nDestroy'd in such a shape.\nHe has deserved it, were it carbuncled\nLike holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:\nThrough Alexandria make a jolly march;\nBear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:\nHad our great palace the capacity\nTo camp this host, we all would sup together,\nAnd drink carouses to the next day's fate,\nWhich promises royal peril. Trumpeters,\nWith brazen din blast you the city's ear;\nMake mingle with rattling tabourines;\nThat heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,\nApplauding our approach.\nTheir preparation is to-day by sea;\nWe please them not by land.\nI would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air;\nWe'ld fight there too. But this it is; our foot\nUpon the hills adjoining to the city\nShall stay with us: order for sea is given;\nThey have put forth the haven\nWhere their appointment we may best discover,\nAnd look on their endeavour.\nYet they are not join'd: where yond pine\ndoes stand,\nI shall discover all: I'll bring thee word\nStraight, how 'tis like to go.\nAll is lost;\nThis foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:\nMy fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder\nThey cast their caps up and carouse together\nLike friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!\n'tis thou\nHast sold me to this novice; and my heart\nMakes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;\nFor when I am revenged upon my charm,\nI have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.\nO sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:\nFortune and Antony part here; even here\nDo we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts\nThat spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave\nTheir wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets\nOn blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,\nThat overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:\nO this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,\xe2\x80\x94\nWhose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;\nWhose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,\xe2\x80\x94\nLike a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,\nBeguiled me to the very heart of loss.\nWhat, Eros, Eros!\nAh, thou spell! Avaunt!\nVanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,\nAnd blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee,\nAnd hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians:\nFollow his chariot, like the greatest spot\nOf all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown\nFor poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let\nPatient Octavia plough thy visage up\nWith her prepared nails.\n'Tis well thou'rt gone,\nIf it be well to live; but better 'twere\nThou fell'st into my fury, for one death\nMight have prevented many. Eros, ho!\nThe shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,\nAlcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage:\nLet me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;\nAnd with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,\nSubdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:\nTo the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall\nUnder this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho!\nEros, thou yet behold'st me?\nSometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;\nA vapour sometime like a bear or lion,\nA tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,\nA forked mountain, or blue promontory\nWith trees upon't, that nod unto the world,\nAnd mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen\nthese signs;\nThey are black vesper's pageants.\nThat which is now a horse, even with a thought\nThe rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,\nAs water is in water.\nMy good knave Eros, now thy captain is\nEven such a body: here I am Antony:\nYet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.\nI made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,\xe2\x80\x94\nWhose heart I thought I had, for she had mine;\nWhich whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't\nA million more, now lost,\xe2\x80\x94she, Eros, has\nPack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory\nUnto an enemy's triumph.\nNay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us\nOurselves to end ourselves.\nO! thy vile lady!\nShe has robb'd me of my sword.\nHence, saucy eunuch; peace!\nShe hath betray'd me and shall die the death.\nDead, then?\nUnarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,\nAnd we must sleep.\nThat thou depart'st hence safe,\nDoes pay thy labour richly; go.\nOff, pluck off:\nThe seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep\nThe battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!\nHeart, once be stronger than thy continent,\nCrack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.\nNo more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;\nYou have been nobly borne. From me awhile.\nI will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and\nWeep for my pardon. So it must be, for now\nAll length is torture: since the torch is out,\nLie down, and stray no farther: now all labour\nMars what it does; yea, very force entangles\nItself with strength: seal then, and all is done.\nEros!\xe2\x80\x94I come, my queen:\xe2\x80\x94Eros!\xe2\x80\x94Stay for me:\nWhere souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,\nAnd with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:\nDido and her AEneas shall want troops,\nAnd all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!\nSince Cleopatra died,\nI have lived in such dishonour, that the gods\nDetest my baseness. I, that with my sword\nQuarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back\nWith ships made cities, condemn myself to lack\nThe courage of a woman; less noble mind\nThan she which by her death our Caesar tells\n'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,\nThat, when the exigent should come, which now\nIs come indeed, when I should see behind me\nThe inevitable prosecution of\nDisgrace and horror, that, on my command,\nThou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:\nThou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.\nPut colour in thy cheek.\nEros,\nWouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see\nThy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down\nHis corrigible neck, his face subdued\nTo penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat\nOf fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded\nHis baseness that ensued?\nCome, then; for with a wound I must be cured.\nDraw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn\nMost useful for thy country.\nWhen I did make thee free, sworest thou not then\nTo do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;\nOr thy precedent services are all\nBut accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.\nLo thee!\nThen let it do at once\nThe thing why thou hast drawn it.\n'Tis said, man; and farewell.\nNow, Eros.\nThrice-nobler than myself!\nThou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what\nI should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros\nHave by their brave instruction got upon me\nA nobleness in record: but I will be\nA bridegroom in my death, and run into't\nAs to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,\nThy master dies thy scholar: to do thus\nI learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?\nThe guard, ho! O, dispatch me!\nI have done my work in, friends: O, make an end\nOf what I have begun.\nLet him that loves me strike me dead.\nArt thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me\nSufficing strokes for death.\nWhen did she send thee?\nWhere is she?\nToo late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee.\nBear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;\n'Tis the last service that I shall command you.\nNay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate\nTo grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome\nWhich comes to punish us, and we punish it\nSeeming to bear it lightly.

Tell me at whose suit.\nGo fetch it, sister.\nThis I wonder at,\nThat he, unknown to me, should be in debt.\nTell me, was he arrested on a band?\nWhat, the chain?\nThe hours come back! that did I never hear.\nAs if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!\nGo, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight;\nAnd bring thy master home immediately.\nCome, sister: I am press'd down with conceit\xe2\x80\x94\nConceit, my comfort and my injury.\nHis incivility confirms no less.\nGood Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;\nEstablish him in his true sense again,\nAnd I will please you what you will demand.\nO, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!\nO husband, God doth know you dined at home;\nWhere would you had remain'd until this time,\nFree from these slanders and this open shame!\nIs't good to soothe him in these contraries?\nAlas, I sent you money to redeem you,\nBy Dromio here, who came in haste for it.\nHe came to me and I deliver'd it.\nI did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.\nDissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.\nO, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.\nWhat wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?\nHast thou delight to see a wretched man\nDo outrage and displeasure to himself?\nI will discharge thee ere I go from thee:\nBear me forthwith unto his creditor,\nAnd, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.\nGood master doctor, see him safe convey'd\nHome to my house. O most unhappy day!\nGo bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.\nSay now, whose suit is he arrested at?\nI know the man. What is the sum he owes?\nSay, how grows it due?\nHe did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.\nIt may be so, but I did never see it.\nCome, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:\nI long to know the truth hereof at large.\nAnd come with naked swords.\nLet's call more help to have them bound again.\nHold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.\nSome get within him, take his sword away:\nBind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.\nTo fetch my poor distracted husband hence.\nLet us come in, that we may bind him fast\nAnd bear him home for his recovery.\nThis week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,\nAnd much different from the man he was;\nBut till this afternoon his passion\nNe'er brake into extremity of rage.\nTo none of these, except it be the last;\nNamely, some love that drew him oft from home.\nWhy, so I did.\nAs roughly as my modesty would let me.\nAnd in assemblies too.\nIt was the copy of our conference:\nIn bed he slept not for my urging it;\nAt board he fed not for my urging it;\nAlone, it was the subject of my theme;\nIn company I often glanced it;\nStill did I tell him it was vile and bad.\nShe did betray me to my own reproof.\nGood people enter and lay hold on him.\nThen let your servants bring my husband forth.\nI will attend my husband, be his nurse,\nDiet his sickness, for it is my office,\nAnd will have no attorney but myself;\nAnd therefore let me have him home with me.\nI will not hence and leave my husband here:\nAnd ill it doth beseem your holiness\nTo separate the husband and the wife.\nCome, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet\nAnd never rise until my tears and prayers\nHave won his grace to come in person hither\nAnd take perforce my husband from the abbess.\nJustice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!\nMay it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,\nWhom I made lord of me and all I had,\nAt your important letters,\xe2\x80\x94this ill day\nA most outrageous fit of madness took him;\nThat desperately he hurried through the street,\nWith him his bondman, all as mad as he\xe2\x80\x94\nDoing displeasure to the citizens\nBy rushing in their houses, bearing thence\nRings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.\nOnce did I get him bound and sent him home,\nWhilst to take order for the wrongs I went,\nThat here and there his fury had committed.\nAnon, I wot not by what strong escape,\nHe broke from those that had the guard of him;\nAnd with his mad attendant and himself,\nEach one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,\nMet us again and madly bent on us,\nChased us away; till, raising of more aid,\nWe came again to bind them. Then they fled\nInto this abbey, whither we pursued them:\nAnd here the abbess shuts the gates on us\nAnd will not suffer us to fetch him out,\nNor send him forth that we may bear him hence.\nTherefore, most gracious duke, with thy command\nLet him be brought forth and borne hence for help.\nPeace, fool! thy master and his man are here,\nAnd that is false thou dost report to us.\nAy me, it is my husband! Witness you,\nThat he is borne about invisible:\nEven now we housed him in the abbey here;\nAnd now he's there, past thought of human reason.\nNo, my good lord: myself, he and my sister\nTo-day did dine together. So befall my soul\nAs this is false he burdens me withal!\nI see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.\nWhich of you two did dine with me to-day?\nAnd are not you my husband?\nI sent you money, sir, to be your bail,\nBy Dromio; but I think he brought it not.\n", 'F')]
