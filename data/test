[("What, John Rugby! I pray thee, go to the casement,\nand see if you can see my master, Master Doctor\nCaius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find any\nbody in the house, here will be an old abusing of\nGod's patience and the king's English.\nGo; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night, in\nfaith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.\nAn honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant\nshall come in house withal, and, I warrant you, no\ntell-tale nor no breed-bate: his worst fault is,\nthat he is given to prayer; he is something peevish\nthat way: but nobody but has his fault; but let\nthat pass. Peter Simple, you say your name is?\nAnd Master Slender's your master?\nDoes he not wear a great round beard, like a\nglover's paring-knife?\nA softly-sprighted man, is he not?\nHow say you? O, I should remember him: does he not\nhold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?\nWell, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune! Tell\nMaster Parson Evans I will do what I can for your\nmaster: Anne is a good girl, and I wish\xe2\x80\x94\nWe shall all be shent. Run in here, good young man;\ngo into this closet: he will not stay long.\nWhat, John Rugby! John! what, John, I say!\nGo, John, go inquire for my master; I doubt\nhe be not well, that he comes not home.\nAnd down, down, adown-a, &c.\nAy, forsooth; I'll fetch it you.\nI am glad he went not in himself: if he had found\nthe young man, he would have been horn-mad.\nIs it this, sir?\nWhat, John Rugby! John!\nAy me, he'll find the young man here, and be mad!\nGood master, be content.\nThe young man is an honest man.\nI beseech you, be not so phlegmatic. Hear the truth\nof it: he came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh.\nPeace, I pray you.\nThis is all, indeed, la! but I'll ne'er put my\nfinger in the fire, and need not.\nI am glad he is so quiet: if he\nhad been thoroughly moved, you should have heard him\nso loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding,\nman, I'll do you your master what good I can: and\nthe very yea and the no is, the French doctor, my\nmaster,\xe2\x80\x94I may call him my master, look you, for I\nkeep his house; and I wash, wring, brew, bake,\nscour, dress meat and drink, make the beds and do\nall myself,\xe2\x80\x94\nAre you avised o' that? you\nshall find it a great charge: and to be up early\nand down late; but notwithstanding,\xe2\x80\x94to tell you in\nyour ear; I would have no words of it,\xe2\x80\x94my master\nhimself is in love with Mistress Anne Page: but\nnotwithstanding that, I know Anne's mind,\xe2\x80\x94that's\nneither here nor there.\nAlas, he speaks but for his friend.\nSir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We\nmust give folks leave to prate: what, the good-jer!\nYou shall have An fool's-head of your own. No, I\nknow Anne's mind for that: never a woman in Windsor\nknows more of Anne's mind than I do; nor can do more\nthan I do with her, I thank heaven.\nWho's there, I trow! Come near the house, I pray you.\nThe better that it pleases your good worship to ask.\nIn truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and\ngentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you\nthat by the way; I praise heaven for it.\nTroth, sir, all is in his hands above: but\nnotwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a\nbook, she loves you. Have not your worship a wart\nabove your eye?\nWell, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is such\nanother Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever\nbroke bread: we had an hour's talk of that wart. I\nshall never laugh but in that maid's company! But\nindeed she is given too much to allicholy and\nmusing: but for you\xe2\x80\x94well, go to.\nWill I? i'faith, that we will; and I will tell your\nworship more of the wart the next time we have\nconfidence; and of other wooers.\nFarewell to your worship.\nTruly, an honest gentleman: but Anne loves him not;\nfor I know Anne's mind as well as another does. Out\nupon't! what have I forgot?\nAy, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?\nGive your worship good morrow.\nNot so, an't please your worship.\nI'll be sworn,\nAs my mother was, the first hour I was born.\nShall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?\nThere is one Mistress Ford, sir:\xe2\x80\x94I pray, come a\nlittle nearer this ways:\xe2\x80\x94I myself dwell with master\nDoctor Caius,\xe2\x80\x94\nYour worship says very true: I pray your worship,\ncome a little nearer this ways.\nAre they so? God bless them and make them his servants!\nWhy, sir, she's a good creature. Lord Lord! your\nworship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you and all\nof us, I pray!\nMarry, this is the short and the long of it; you\nhave brought her into such a canaries as 'tis\nwonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the\ncourt lay at Windsor, could never have brought her\nto such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and\nlords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant\nyou, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift\nafter gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so\nrushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in\nsuch alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of\nthe best and the fairest, that would have won any\nwoman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could never\nget an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels\ngiven me this morning; but I defy all angels, in\nany such sort, as they say, but in the way of\nhonesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get\nher so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of\nthem all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which\nis more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.\nMarry, she hath received your letter, for the which\nshe thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you\nto notify that her husband will be absence from his\nhouse between ten and eleven.\nAy, forsooth; and then you may come and see the\npicture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,\nher husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet\nwoman leads an ill life with him: he's a very\njealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with\nhim, good heart.\nWhy, you say well. But I have another messenger to\nyour worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty\ncommendations to you too: and let me tell you in\nyour ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and\none, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor\nevening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the\nother: and she bade me tell your worship that her\nhusband is seldom from home; but she hopes there\nwill come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon\na man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.\nBlessing on your heart for't!\nThat were a jest indeed! they have not so little\ngrace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but\nMistress Page would desire you to send her your\nlittle page, of all loves: her husband has a\nmarvellous infection to the little page; and truly\nMaster Page is an honest man. Never a wife in\nWindsor leads a better life than she does: do what\nshe will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go\nto bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as\nshe will: and truly she deserves it; for if there\nbe a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must\nsend her your page; no remedy.\nNay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come and\ngo between you both; and in any case have a\nnay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and\nthe boy never need to understand any thing; for\n'tis not good that children should know any\nwickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,\nas they say, and know the world.\nHark ye; Master Slender would speak a word with you.\nAnd how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word with you.\nSpeak to Mistress Page.\nThat's my master, master doctor.\nThis is my doing, now: 'Nay,' said I, 'will you cast\naway your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on\nMaster Fenton:' this is my doing.\nNow heaven send thee good fortune!\nA kind heart he hath: a woman would run through\nfire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I\nwould my master had Mistress Anne; or I would\nMaster Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master\nFenton had her; I will do what I can for them all\nthree; for so I have promised, and I'll be as good\nas my word; but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,\nI must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from\nmy two mistresses: what a beast am I to slack it!\nBy your leave; I cry you mercy: give your worship\ngood morrow.\nMarry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.\nAlas the day! good heart, that was not her fault:\nshe does so take on with her men; they mistook their erection.\nWell, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn\nyour heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning\na-birding; she desires you once more to come to her\nbetween eight and nine: I must carry her word\nquickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.\nI will tell her.\nEight and nine, sir.\nPeace be with you, sir.\nSure he is by this, or will be presently: but,\ntruly, he is very courageous mad about his throwing\ninto the water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.\nBlessing of his heart!\nTruly, I thought there had been one number more,\nbecause they say, 'Od's nouns.'\nPolecats! there are fairer things than polecats, sure.\n'Hang-hog' is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.\nAnd that's a good root.\nVengeance of Jenny's case! fie on her! never name\nher, child, if she be a whore.\nYou do ill to teach the child such words: he\nteaches him to hick and to hack, which they'll do\nfast enough of themselves, and to call 'horum:' fie upon you!\nFrom the two parties, forsooth.\nAnd have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant;\nspeciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart,\nis beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a\nwhite spot about her.\nSir, let me speak with you in your chamber: you\nshall hear how things go; and, I warrant, to your\ncontent. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good\nhearts, what ado here is to bring you together!\nSure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that\nyou are so crossed.\nI'll provide you a chain; and I'll do what I can to\nget you a pair of horns.\nFairies, black, grey, green, and white,\nYou moonshine revellers and shades of night,\nYou orphan heirs of fixed destiny,\nAttend your office and your quality.\nCrier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.\nAbout, about;\nSearch Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:\nStrew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:.

I am sure he is in\nthe fleet: I would he had boarded me.\nDo, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;\nwhich, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,\nstrikes him into melancholy; and then there's a\npartridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no\nsupper that night.\nWe must follow the leaders.\nNay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at\nthe next turning.\nIndeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave\nhim use for it, a double heart for his single one:\nmarry, once before he won it of me with false dice,\ntherefore your grace may well say I have lost it.\nSo I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I\nshould prove the mother of fools. I have brought\nCount Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.\nThe count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor\nwell; but civil count, civil as an orange, and\nsomething of that jealous complexion.\nSpeak, count, 'tis your cue.\nSpeak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth\nwith a kiss, and let not him speak neither.\nYea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on\nthe windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his\near that he is in her heart.\nGood Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the\nworld but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a\ncorner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!\nI would rather have one of your father's getting.\nHath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your\nfather got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.\nNo, my lord, unless I might have another for\nworking-days: your grace is too costly to wear\nevery day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I\nwas born to speak all mirth and no matter.\nNo, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there\nwas a star danced, and under that was I born.\nCousins, God give you joy!\nI cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.\nAgainst my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.\nI took no more pains for those thanks than you take\npains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would\nnot have come.\nYea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's\npoint and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,\nsignior: fare you well.\nWhat fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?\nStand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?\nContempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!\nNo glory lives behind the back of such.\nAnd, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,\nTaming my wild heart to thy loving hand:\nIf thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee\nTo bind our loves up in a holy band;\nFor others say thou dost deserve, and I\nBelieve it better than reportingly.\nGood morrow, sweet Hero.\nI am out of all other tune, methinks.\nYe light o' love, with your heels! then, if your\nhusband have stables enough, you'll see he shall\nlack no barns.\n'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; tis time you were\nready.

God help me! how long have you\nprofessed apprehension?\nIt is not seen enough, you should wear it in your\ncap. By my troth, I am sick.\nBenedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in\nthis Benedictus.\nWhat pace is this that thy tongue keeps?\nWhy, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?\nDead, I think.

It were as\npossible for me to say I loved nothing so well as\nyou: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I\nconfess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.\nDo not swear, and eat it.\nWill you not eat your word?\nWhy, then, God forgive me!\nYou have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to\nprotest I loved you.\nI love you with so much of my heart that none is\nleft to protest.\nKill Claudio.\nYou kill me to deny it. Farewell.\nI am gone, though I am here: there is no love in\nyou: nay, I pray you, let me go.\nIn faith, I will go.\nYou dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.\nIs he not approved in the height a villain, that\nhath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman?

I would eat his heart\nin the market-place.\nTalk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!\nSweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.\nPrinces and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,\na goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,\nsurely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I\nhad any friend would be a man for my sake! But\nmanhood is melted into courtesies, valour into\ncompliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and\ntrim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules\nthat only tells a lie and swears it.

But for which of my\ngood parts did you first suffer love for me?\nIn spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!\nIf you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for\nyours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.\nIt appears not in this confession: there's not one\nwise man among twenty that will praise himself.\nAnd how long is that, think you?\nVery ill.\nVery ill too.\nWill you go hear this news, signior?\nI answer to that name.

I have hope\nYou less know how to value her desert\nThan she to scant her duty.\nI cannot think my sister in the least\nWould fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance\nShe have restrain'd the riots of your followers,\n'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,\nAs clears her from all blame.\nO, sir, you are old!\nNature in you stands on the very verge\nOf her confine. You should be rul'd, and led\nBy some discretion that discerns your state\nBetter than you yourself. Therefore I pray you\nThat to our sister you do make return;\nSay you have wrong'd her, sir.\nGood sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.\nReturn you to my sister.\nO the blest gods! so will you wish on me\nWhen the rash mood is on.\nGood sir, to th' purpose.\nI know't- my sister's. This approves her letter,\nThat she would soon be here.\nIs your lady come?\nI pray you, father, being weak, seem so.\nIf, till the expiration of your month,\nYou will return and sojourn with my sister,\nDismissing half your train, come then to me.\nI am now from home, and out of that provision\nWhich shall be needful for your entertainment.\nNot altogether so.\nI look'd not for you yet, nor am provided\nFor your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;\nFor those that mingle reason with your passion\nMust be content to think you old, and so-\nBut she knows what she does.\nI dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?\nIs it not well? What should you need of more?\nYea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger\nSpeak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house\nShould many people, under two commands,\nHold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.\nWhy not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack ye,\nWe could control them. If you will come to me\n(For now I spy a danger), I entreat you\nTo bring but five-and-twenty. To no more\nWill I give place or notice.\nAnd in good time you gave it!\nAnd speak't again my lord. No more with me.\nWhat need one?\nThis house is little; the old man and 's people\nCannot be well bestow'd.\nFor his particular, I'll receive him gladly,\nBut not one follower.\nO, sir, to wilful men\nThe injuries that they themselves procure\nMust be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.\nHe is attended with a desperate train,\nAnd what they may incense him to, being apt\nTo have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear.\nHang him instantly.\nIngrateful fox! 'tis he.\nHard, hard. O filthy traitor!\nSo white, and such a traitor!\nBe simple-answer'd, for we know the truth.\nTo whose hands have you sent the lunatic King?\nSpeak.\nAnd false.\nWherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg'd at peril-\nWherefore to Dover, sir?\nOne side will mock another. Th' other too!\nHow now, you dog?\nWhat do you mean?\nGive me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?\nShe takes a sword and runs at him behind.\nOut, treacherous villain!\nThou call'st on him that hates thee. It was he\nThat made the overture of thy treasons to us;\nWho is too good to pity thee.\nGo thrust him out at gates, and let him smell\nHis way to Dover. \nHow is't, my lord? How look you?\nBut are my brother's pow'rs set forth?\nHimself in person there?\nLord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?\nWhat might import my sister's letter to him?\nFaith, he is posted hence on serious matter.\nIt was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,\nTo let him live. Where he arrives he moves\nAll hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,\nIn pity of his misery, to dispatch\nHis nighted life; moreover, to descry\nThe strength o' th' enemy.\nOur troops set forth to-morrow. Stay with us.\nThe ways are dangerous.\nWhy should she write to Edmund? Might not you\nTransport her purposes by word? Belike,\nSomething- I know not what- I'll love thee much-\nLet me unseal the letter.\nI know your lady does not love her husband;\nI am sure of that; and at her late being here\nShe gave strange eyeliads and most speaking looks\nTo noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.\nI speak in understanding. Y'are! I know't.\nTherefore I do advise you take this note.\nMy lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd,\nAnd more convenient is he for my hand\nThan for your lady's. You may gather more.\nIf you do find him, pray you give him this;\nAnd when your mistress hears thus much from you,\nI pray desire her call her wisdom to her.\nSo farewell.\nIf you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,\nPreferment falls on him that cuts him off.\nFare thee well. Exeunt.\nOur sister's man is certainly miscarried.\nNow, sweet lord,\nYou know the goodness I intend upon you.\nTell me- but truly- but then speak the truth-\nDo you not love my sister?\nBut have you never found my brother's way\nTo the forfended place?\nI am doubtful that you have been conjunct\nAnd bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.\nI never shall endure her. Dear my lord,\nBe not familiar with her.\nWhy is this reason'd?\nSister, you'll go with us?\n'Tis most convenient. Pray you go with us.\nThat's as we list to grace him.\nMethinks our pleasure might have been demanded\nEre you had spoke so far. He led our powers,\nBore the commission of my place and person,\nThe which immediacy may well stand up\nAnd call itself your brother.\nIn my rights\nBy me invested, he compeers the best.\nJesters do oft prove prophets.\nLady, I am not well; else I should answer\nFrom a full-flowing stomach. General,\nTake thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;\nDispose of them, of me; the walls are thine.\nWitness the world that I create thee here\nMy lord and master.\nLet the drum strike, and prove my title thine.\nSick, O, sick!\nMy sickness grows upon me.\n", 'F'), ("All which time\nBefore the gods my knee shall bow my prayers\nTo them for you.\nMy noble brother!\nSir, look well to my husband's house; and\xe2\x80\x94\nI'll tell you in your ear.\nO my good lord,\nBelieve not all; or, if you must believe,\nStomach not all.

But soft! how many months\nDo you desire?\nRest you fair, good signior;\nYour worship was the last man in our mouths.\nAy, ay, three thousand ducats.\nI had forgot; three months; you told me so.\nWell then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;\nMethought you said you neither lend nor borrow\nUpon advantage.\nWhen Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep\xe2\x80\x94\nThis Jacob from our holy Abram was,\nAs his wise mother wrought in his behalf,\nThe third possessor; ay, he was the third\xe2\x80\x94\nNo, not take interest, not, as you would say,\nDirectly interest: mark what Jacob did.\nWhen Laban and himself were compromised\nThat all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied\nShould fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,\nIn the end of autumn turned to the rams,\nAnd, when the work of generation was\nBetween these woolly breeders in the act,\nThe skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,\nAnd, in the doing of the deed of kind,\nHe stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,\nWho then conceiving did in eaning time\nFall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.\nThis was a way to thrive, and he was blest:\nAnd thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.\nI cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:\nBut note me, signior.\nThree thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.\nThree months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate\xe2\x80\x94\nSignior Antonio, many a time and oft\nIn the Rialto you have rated me\nAbout my moneys and my usances:\nStill have I borne it with a patient shrug,\nFor sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.\nYou call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,\nAnd spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,\nAnd all for use of that which is mine own.\nWell then, it now appears you need my help:\nGo to, then; you come to me, and you say\n'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;\nYou, that did void your rheum upon my beard\nAnd foot me as you spurn a stranger cur\nOver your threshold: moneys is your suit\nWhat should I say to you? Should I not say\n'Hath a dog money? is it possible\nA cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or\nShall I bend low and in a bondman's key,\nWith bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;\n'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;\nYou spurn'd me such a day; another time\nYou call'd me dog; and for these courtesies\nI'll lend you thus much moneys'?\nWhy, look you, how you storm!\nI would be friends with you and have your love,\nForget the shames that you have stain'd me with,\nSupply your present wants and take no doit\nOf usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:\nThis is kind I offer.\nThis kindness will I show.\nGo with me to a notary, seal me there\nYour single bond; and, in a merry sport,\nIf you repay me not on such a day,\nIn such a place, such sum or sums as are\nExpress'd in the condition, let the forfeit\nBe nominated for an equal pound\nOf your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken\nIn what part of your body pleaseth me.\nO father Abram, what these Christians are,\nWhose own hard dealings teaches them suspect\nThe thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;\nIf he should break his day, what should I gain\nBy the exaction of the forfeiture?\nA pound of man's flesh taken from a man\nIs not so estimable, profitable neither,\nAs flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,\nTo buy his favour, I extend this friendship:\nIf he will take it, so; if not, adieu;\nAnd, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.\nThen meet me forthwith at the notary's;\nGive him direction for this merry bond,\nAnd I will go and purse the ducats straight,\nSee to my house, left in the fearful guard\nOf an unthrifty knave, and presently\nI will be with you.\nWell, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,\nThe difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:\xe2\x80\x94\nWhat, Jessica!\xe2\x80\x94thou shalt not gormandise,\nAs thou hast done with me:\xe2\x80\x94What, Jessica!\xe2\x80\x94\nAnd sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;\xe2\x80\x94\nWhy, Jessica, I say!\nWho bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.\nI am bid forth to supper, Jessica:\nThere are my keys. But wherefore should I go?\nI am not bid for love; they flatter me:\nBut yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon\nThe prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,\nLook to my house. I am right loath to go:\nThere is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,\nFor I did dream of money-bags to-night.\nSo do I his.\nWhat, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:\nLock up my doors; and when you hear the drum\nAnd the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,\nClamber not you up to the casements then,\nNor thrust your head into the public street\nTo gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,\nBut stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:\nLet not the sound of shallow foppery enter\nMy sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,\nI have no mind of feasting forth to-night:\nBut I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;\nSay I will come.\nWhat says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?\nThe patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;\nSnail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day\nMore than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me;\nTherefore I part with him, and part with him\nTo one that would have him help to waste\nHis borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;\nPerhaps I will return immediately:\nDo as I bid you; shut doors after you:\nFast bind, fast find;\nA proverb never stale in thrifty mind.\nYou know, none so well, none so well as you, of my\ndaughter's flight.\nShe is damned for it.\nMy own flesh and blood to rebel!\nI say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.\nThere I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a\nprodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the\nRialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon\nthe mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to\ncall me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was\nwont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him\nlook to his bond.\nTo bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,\nit will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and\nhindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,\nmocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my\nbargains, cooled my friends, heated mine\nenemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath\nnot a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,\ndimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with\nthe same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject\nto the same diseases, healed by the same means,\nwarmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as\na Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?\nif you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison\nus, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not\nrevenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will\nresemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,\nwhat is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian\nwrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by\nChristian example? Why, revenge. The villany you\nteach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I\nwill better the instruction.\nHow now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou\nfound my daughter?\nWhy, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,\ncost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse\nnever fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it\ntill now: two thousand ducats in that; and other\nprecious, precious jewels. I would my daughter\nwere dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!\nwould she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in\nher coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know\nnot what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon\nloss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to\nfind the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:\nnor no in luck stirring but what lights on my\nshoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears\nbut of my shedding.\nWhat, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?\nI thank God, I thank God.

Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my\nturquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:\nI would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.\nNay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee\nme an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I\nwill have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were\nhe out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I\nwill. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;\ngo, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.\nGaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;\nThis is the fool that lent out money gratis:\nGaoler, look to him.\nI'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:\nI have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.\nThou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;\nBut, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:\nThe duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,\nThou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond\nTo come abroad with him at his request.\nI'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:\nI'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.\nI'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,\nTo shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield\nTo Christian intercessors. Follow not;\nI'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.\nI have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;\nAnd by our holy Sabbath have I sworn\nTo have the due and forfeit of my bond:\nIf you deny it, let the danger light\nUpon your charter and your city's freedom.\nYou'll ask me, why I rather choose to have\nA weight of carrion flesh than to receive\nThree thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:\nBut, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?\nWhat if my house be troubled with a rat\nAnd I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats\nTo have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?\nSome men there are love not a gaping pig;\nSome, that are mad if they behold a cat;\nAnd others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,\nCannot contain their urine: for affection,\nMistress of passion, sways it to the mood\nOf what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:\nAs there is no firm reason to be render'd,\nWhy he cannot abide a gaping pig;\nWhy he, a harmless necessary cat;\nWhy he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force\nMust yield to such inevitable shame\nAs to offend, himself being offended;\nSo can I give no reason, nor I will not,\nMore than a lodged hate and a certain loathing\nI bear Antonio, that I follow thus\nA losing suit against him.

You will answer\n'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:\nThe pound of flesh, which I demand of him,\nIs dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.\nIf you deny me, fie upon your law!\nThere is no force in the decrees of Venice.\nI stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?\nTo cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.\nNo, none that thou hast wit enough to make.\nTill thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,\nThou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:\nRepair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall\nTo cureless ruin.

But, come, away;\nGet me ink and paper:\nHe shall have every day a several greeting,\nOr I'll unpeople Egypt.\nGive me some music; music, moody food\nOf us that trade in love.\nLet it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian.\nAs well a woman with an eunuch play'd\nAs with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?\nAnd when good will is show'd, though't come\ntoo short,\nThe actor may plead pardon. I'll none now:\nGive me mine angle; we'll to the river: there,\nMy music playing far off, I will betray\nTawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce\nTheir slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,\nI'll think them every one an Antony,\nAnd say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.'\nThat time,\xe2\x80\x94O times!\xe2\x80\x94\nI laugh'd him out of patience; and that night\nI laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,\nEre the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;\nThen put my tires and mantles on him, whilst\nI wore his sword Philippan.\nO, from Italy\nRam thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,\nThat long time have been barren.\nAntonius dead!\xe2\x80\x94If thou say so, villain,\nThou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,\nIf thou so yield him, there is gold, and here\nMy bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings\nHave lipp'd, and trembled kissing.\nWhy, there's more gold.\nBut, sirrah, mark, we use\nTo say the dead are well: bring it to that,\nThe gold I give thee will I melt and pour\nDown thy ill-uttering throat.\nWell, go to, I will;\nBut there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony\nBe free and healthful,\xe2\x80\x94so tart a favour\nTo trumpet such good tidings! If not well,\nThou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,\nNot like a formal man.\nI have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:\nYet if thou say Antony lives, is well,\nOr friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,\nI'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail\nRich pearls upon thee.\nWell said.\nThou'rt an honest man.\nMake thee a fortune from me.\nI do not like 'But yet,' it does allay\nThe good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!\n'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth\nSome monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,\nPour out the pack of matter to mine ear,\nThe good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:\nIn state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.\nFor what good turn?\nI am pale, Charmian.\nThe most infectious pestilence upon thee!\nWhat say you? Hence,\nHorrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes\nLike balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:\nThou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,\nSmarting in lingering pickle.\nSay 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,\nAnd make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst\nShall make thy peace for moving me to rage;\nAnd I will boot thee with what gift beside\nThy modesty can beg.\nRogue, thou hast lived too long.\nSome innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.\nMelt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures\nTurn all to serpents! Call the slave again:\nThough I am mad, I will not bite him: call.\nI will not hurt him.\nThese hands do lack nobility, that they strike\nA meaner than myself; since I myself\nHave given myself the cause.\nCome hither, sir.\nThough it be honest, it is never good\nTo bring bad news: give to a gracious message.\nAn host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell\nThemselves when they be felt.\nIs he married?\nI cannot hate thee worser than I do,\nIf thou again say 'Yes.'\nThe gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?\nO, I would thou didst,\nSo half my Egypt were submerged and made\nA cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence:\nHadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me\nThou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?\nHe is married?\nO, that his fault should make a knave of thee,\nThat art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:\nThe merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome\nAre all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,\nAnd be undone by 'em!\nIn praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.\nI am paid for't now.\nLead me from hence:\nI faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter.\nGo to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him\nReport the feature of Octavia, her years,\nHer inclination, let him not leave out\nThe colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.\nLet him for ever go:\xe2\x80\x94let him not\xe2\x80\x94Charmian,\nThough he be painted one way like a Gorgon,\nThe other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas\nBring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,\nBut do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.\nWhere is the fellow?\nGo to, go to.\nCome hither, sir.\nThat Herod's head\nI'll have: but how, when Antony is gone\nThrough whom I might command it? Come thou near.\nDidst thou behold Octavia?\nWhere?\nIs she as tall as me?\nDidst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?\nThat's not so good: he cannot like her long.\nI think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!\nWhat majesty is in her gait? Remember,\nIf e'er thou look'dst on majesty.\nIs this certain?\nHe's very knowing;\nI do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:\nThe fellow has good judgment.\nGuess at her years, I prithee.\nWidow! Charmian, hark.\nBear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?\nFor the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.\nHer hair, what colour?\nThere's gold for thee.\nThou must not take my former sharpness ill:\nI will employ thee back again; I find thee\nMost fit for business: go make thee ready;\nOur letters are prepared.\nIndeed, he is so: I repent me much\nThat so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,\nThis creature's no such thing.\nThe man hath seen some majesty, and should know.\nI have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:\nBut 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me\nWhere I will write. All may be well enough.\nI will be even with thee, doubt it not.\nThou hast forspoke my being in these wars,\nAnd say'st it is not fit.\nIf not denounced against us, why should not we\nBe there in person?\nWhat is't you say?\nSink Rome, and their tongues rot\nThat speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,\nAnd, as the president of my kingdom, will\nAppear there for a man. Speak not against it:\nI will not stay behind.\nCelerity is never more admired\nThan by the negligent.\nBy sea! what else?\nI have sixty sails, Caesar none better.\nLet me sit down. O Juno!\nAh, stand by.\nWell then, sustain him: O!\nO my lord, my lord,\nForgive my fearful sails! I little thought\nYou would have follow'd.\nO, my pardon!\nPardon, pardon!\nWhat shall we do, Enobarbus?\nIs Antony or we in fault for this?\nPrithee, peace.\nThat head, my lord?\nWhat, no more ceremony? See, my women!\nAgainst the blown rose may they stop their nose\nThat kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.\nCaesar's will?\nNone but friends: say boldly.\nGo on: right royal.\nO!\nHe is a god, and knows\nWhat is most right: mine honour was not yielded,\nBut conquer'd merely.\nWhat's your name?\nMost kind messenger,\nSay to great Caesar this: in deputation\nI kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt\nTo lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:\nTell him from his all-obeying breath I hear\nThe doom of Egypt.\nYour Caesar's father oft,\nWhen he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,\nBestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,\nAs it rain'd kisses.\nGood my lord,\xe2\x80\x94\nO, is't come to this?\nWherefore is this?\nHave you done yet?\nI must stay his time.\nNot know me yet?\nAh, dear, if I be so,\nFrom my cold heart let heaven engender hail,\nAnd poison it in the source; and the first stone\nDrop in my neck: as it determines, so\nDissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!\nTill by degrees the memory of my womb,\nTogether with my brave Egyptians all,\nBy the discandying of this pelleted storm,\nLie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile\nHave buried them for prey!\nThat's my brave lord!\nIt is my birth-day:\nI had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord\nIs Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.\nCall all his noble captains to my lord.\nWhat means this?\nWhat does he mean?\nSleep a little.\nNay, I'll help too.\nWhat's this for?\nSooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be.\nIs not this buckled well?\nLead me.\nHe goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might\nDetermine this great war in single fight!\nThen Antony,\xe2\x80\x94but now\xe2\x80\x94Well, on.\nLord of lords!\nO infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from\nThe world's great snare uncaught?\nI'll give thee, friend,\nAn armour all of gold; it was a king's.\nWhy is my lord enraged against his love?\nHelp me, my women! O, he is more mad\nThan Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly\nWas never so emboss'd.\nTo the monument!\nMardian, go tell him I have slain myself;\nSay, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'\nAnd word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian,\nAnd bring me how he takes my death.\nTo the monument!\nO Charmian, I will never go from hence.\nNo, I will not:\nAll strange and terrible events are welcome,\nBut comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,\nProportion'd to our cause, must be as great\nAs that which makes it.\nHow now! is he dead?\nO sun,\nBurn the great sphere thou movest in!\ndarkling stand\nThe varying shore o' the world. O Antony,\nAntony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;\nHelp, friends below; let's draw him hither.\nSo it should be, that none but Antony\nShould conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!\nI dare not, dear,\xe2\x80\x94\nDear my lord, pardon,\xe2\x80\x94I dare not,\nLest I be taken: not the imperious show\nOf the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall\nBe brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,\nserpents, have\nEdge, sting, or operation, I am safe:\nYour wife Octavia, with her modest eyes\nAnd still conclusion, shall acquire no honour\nDemuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,\xe2\x80\x94\nHelp me, my women,\xe2\x80\x94we must draw thee up:\nAssist, good friends.\nHere's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!\nOur strength is all gone into heaviness,\nThat makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,\nThe strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,\nAnd set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,\xe2\x80\x94\nWishes were ever fools,\xe2\x80\x94O, come, come, come;\nAnd welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:\nQuicken with kissing: had my lips that power,\nThus would I wear them out.\nNo, let me speak; and let me rail so high,\nThat the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,\nProvoked by my offence.\nThey do not go together.\nMy resolution and my hands I'll trust;\nNone about Caesar.\nNoblest of men, woo't die?\nHast thou no care of me? shall I abide\nIn this dull world, which in thy absence is\nNo better than a sty? O, see, my women,\nThe crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!\nO, wither'd is the garland of the war,\nThe soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls\nAre level now with men; the odds is gone,\nAnd there is nothing left remarkable\nBeneath the visiting moon.\nNo more, but e'en a woman, and commanded\nBy such poor passion as the maid that milks\nAnd does the meanest chares. It were for me\nTo throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;\nTo tell them that this world did equal theirs\nTill they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;\nPatience is scottish, and impatience does\nBecome a dog that's mad: then is it sin\nTo rush into the secret house of death,\nEre death dare come to us? How do you, women?\nWhat, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!\nMy noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,\nOur lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:\nWe'll bury him; and then, what's brave,\nwhat's noble,\nLet's do it after the high Roman fashion,\nAnd make death proud to take us. Come, away:\nThis case of that huge spirit now is cold:\nAh, women, women! come; we have no friend\nBut resolution, and the briefest end.\nMy desolation does begin to make\nA better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;\nNot being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,\nA minister of her will: and it is great\nTo do that thing that ends all other deeds;\nWhich shackles accidents and bolts up change;\nWhich sleeps, and never palates more the dug,\nThe beggar's nurse and Caesar's.\nWhat's thy name?\nAntony\nDid tell me of you, bade me trust you; but\nI do not greatly care to be deceived,\nThat have no use for trusting. If your master\nWould have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,\nThat majesty, to keep decorum, must\nNo less beg than a kingdom: if he please\nTo give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,\nHe gives me so much of mine own, as I\nWill kneel to him with thanks.\nPray you, tell him\nI am his fortune's vassal, and I send him\nThe greatness he has got. I hourly learn\nA doctrine of obedience; and would gladly\nLook him i' the face.\nQuick, quick, good hands.\nWhat, of death too,\nThat rids our dogs of languish?\nWhere art thou, death?\nCome hither, come! come, come, and take a queen\nWorthy many babes and beggars!\nSir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;\nIf idle talk will once be necessary,\nI'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,\nDo Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I\nWill not wait pinion'd at your master's court;\nNor once be chastised with the sober eye\nOf dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up\nAnd show me to the shouting varletry\nOf censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt\nBe gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud\nLay me stark naked, and let the water-flies\nBlow me into abhorring! rather make\nMy country's high pyramides my gibbet,\nAnd hang me up in chains!\nSay, I would die.\nI cannot tell.\nNo matter, sir, what I have heard or known.\nYou laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;\nIs't not your trick?\nI dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:\nO, such another sleep, that I might see\nBut such another man!\nHis face was as the heavens; and therein stuck\nA sun and moon, which kept their course,\nand lighted\nThe little O, the earth.\nHis legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm\nCrested the world: his voice was propertied\nAs all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;\nBut when he meant to quail and shake the orb,\nHe was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,\nThere was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas\nThat grew the more by reaping: his delights\nWere dolphin-like; they show'd his back above\nThe element they lived in: in his livery\nWalk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were\nAs plates dropp'd from his pocket.\nThink you there was, or might be, such a man\nAs this I dream'd of?\nYou lie, up to the hearing of the gods.\nBut, if there be, or ever were, one such,\nIt's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff\nTo vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine\nAnd Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,\nCondemning shadows quite.\nI thank you, sir,\nKnow you what Caesar means to do with me?\nNay, pray you, sir,\xe2\x80\x94\nHe'll lead me, then, in triumph?\nSir, the gods\nWill have it thus; my master and my lord\nI must obey.\nSole sir o' the world,\nI cannot project mine own cause so well\nTo make it clear; but do confess I have\nBeen laden with like frailties which before\nHave often shamed our sex.\nAnd may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,\nYour scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall\nHang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.\nThis is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,\nI am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;\nNot petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?\nThis is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,\nUpon his peril, that I have reserved\nTo myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.\nWhat have I kept back?\nSee, Caesar! O, behold,\nHow pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;\nAnd, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.\nThe ingratitude of this Seleucus does\nEven make me wild: O slave, of no more trust\nThan love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt\nGo back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,\nThough they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!\nO rarely base!\nO Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,\nThat thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,\nDoing the honour of thy lordliness\nTo one so meek, that mine own servant should\nParcel the sum of my disgraces by\nAddition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,\nThat I some lady trifles have reserved,\nImmoment toys, things of such dignity\nAs we greet modern friends withal; and say,\nSome nobler token I have kept apart\nFor Livia and Octavia, to induce\nTheir mediation; must I be unfolded\nWith one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me\nBeneath the fall I have.\nPrithee, go hence;\nOr I shall show the cinders of my spirits\nThrough the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,\nThou wouldst have mercy on me.\nBe it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought\nFor things that others do; and, when we fall,\nWe answer others' merits in our name,\nAre therefore to be pitied.\nMy master, and my lord!\nHe words me, girls, he words me, that I should not\nBe noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.\nHie thee again:\nI have spoke already, and it is provided;\nGo put it to the haste.\nDolabella!\nDolabella,\nI shall remain your debtor.\nFarewell, and thanks.\nNow, Iras, what think'st thou?\nThou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown\nIn Rome, as well as I. mechanic slaves\nWith greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall\nUplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,\nRank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,\nAnd forced to drink their vapour.\nNay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors\nWill catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers\nBallad us out o' tune: the quick comedians\nExtemporally will stage us, and present\nOur Alexandrian revels; Antony\nShall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see\nSome squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness\nI' the posture of a whore.\nNay, that's certain.\nWhy, that's the way\nTo fool their preparation, and to conquer\nTheir most absurd intents.\nNow, Charmian!\nShow me, my women, like a queen: go fetch\nMy best attires: I am again for Cydnus,\nTo meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.\nNow, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;\nAnd, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave\nTo play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.\nWherefore's this noise?\nLet him come in.\nWhat poor an instrument\nMay do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.\nMy resolution's placed, and I have nothing\nOf woman in me: now from head to foot\nI am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon\nNo planet is of mine.\nAvoid, and leave him.\nHast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,\nThat kills and pains not?\nRememberest thou any that have died on't?\nGet thee hence; farewell.\nFarewell.\nAy, ay; farewell.\nTake thou no care; it shall be heeded.\nWill it eat me?\nWell, get thee gone; farewell.\nGive me my robe, put on my crown; I have\nImmortal longings in me: now no more\nThe juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:\nYare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear\nAntony call; I see him rouse himself\nTo praise my noble act; I hear him mock\nThe luck of Caesar, which the gods give men\nTo excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:\nNow to that name my courage prove my title!\nI am fire and air; my other elements\nI give to baser life. So; have you done?\nCome then, and take the last warmth of my lips.\nFarewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.\nHave I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?\nIf thou and nature can so gently part,\nThe stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,\nWhich hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?\nIf thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world\nIt is not worth leave-taking.\nThis proves me base:\nIf she first meet the curled Antony,\nHe'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss\nWhich is my heaven to have. Come, thou\nmortal wretch,\nWith thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate\nOf life at once untie: poor venomous fool\nBe angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,\nThat I might hear thee call great Caesar ass\nUnpolicied!\nPeace, peace!\nDost thou not see my baby at my breast,\nThat sucks the nurse asleep?\nAs sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,\xe2\x80\x94\nO Antony!\xe2\x80\x94Nay, I will take thee too.\nWhat should I stay\xe2\x80\x94\n", 'F'), ("Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried\nto prison was worth five thousand of you all.\nMarry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.\nNay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw\nhim carried away; and, which is more, within these\nthree days his head to be chopped off.\nI am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam\nJulietta with child.\nThus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what\nwith the gallows and what with poverty, I am\ncustom-shrunk.\nHow now! what's the news with you?\nWell; what has he done?\nBut what's his offence?\nWhat, is there a maid with child by him?\nWhat proclamation, man?\nAnd what shall become of those in the city?\nBut shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be\npulled down?\nWhy, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!\nWhat shall become of me?\nWhat's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.\nGood my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted\na merciful man; good my lord.\nMy lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.\nMistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the\nduke's time; he promised her marriage: his child\nis a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:\nI have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!\n", 'F'), ("Come, bring them away: if these be good people in\na commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in\ncommon houses, I know no law: bring them away.\nIf it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's\nconstable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon\njustice, sir, and do bring in here before your good\nhonour two notorious benefactors.\nIf it? please your honour, I know not well what they\nare: but precise villains they are, that I am sure\nof; and void of all profanation in the world that\ngood Christians ought to have.\nHe, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that\nserves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they\nsay, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she\nprofesses a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.\nMy wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,\xe2\x80\x94\nAy, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,\xe2\x80\x94\nI say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as\nshe, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,\nit is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.\nMarry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman\ncardinally given, might have been accused in\nfornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.\nAy, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she\nspit in his face, so she defied him.\nProve it before these varlets here, thou honourable\nman; prove it.\nI beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.\nFirst, an it like you, the house is a respected\nhouse; next, this is a respected fellow; and his\nmistress is a respected woman.\nVarlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the\ntime has yet to come that she was ever respected\nwith man, woman, or child.\nO thou caitiff!

Madam Silvia!\nShe is not within hearing, sir.\nYour worship, sir; or else I mistook.\nAnd yet I was last chidden for being too slow.\nShe that your worship loves?\nMarry, by these special marks: first, you have\nlearned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,\nlike a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a\nrobin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had\nthe pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had\nlost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had\nburied her grandam; to fast, like one that takes\ndiet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to\nspeak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were\nwont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you\nwalked, to walk like one of the lions; when you\nfasted, it was presently after dinner; when you\nlooked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you\nare metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look\non you, I can hardly think you my master.\nThey are all perceived without ye.\nWithout you? nay, that's certain, for, without you\nwere so simple, none else would: but you are so\nwithout these follies, that these follies are within\nyou and shine through you like the water in an\nurinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a\nphysician to comment on your malady.\nShe that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?\nWhy, sir, I know her not.\nIs she not hard-favoured, sir?\nSir, I know that well enough.\nThat she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.\nThat's because the one is painted and the other out\nof all count.\nMarry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no\nman counts of her beauty.\nYou never saw her since she was deformed.\nEver since you loved her.\nIf you love her, you cannot see her.\nBecause Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;\nor your own eyes had the lights they were wont to\nhave when you chid at Sir Proteus for going\nungartered!\nYour own present folly and her passing deformity:\nfor he, being in love, could not see to garter his\nhose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.\nTrue, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,\nyou swinged me for my love, which makes me the\nbolder to chide you for yours.\nI would you were set, so your affection would cease.\nAnd have you?\nAre they not lamely writ?\nO excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!\nNow will he interpret to her.\nO, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.\nHe should give her interest and she gives it him.\nAnd yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'\nO jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,\nAs a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!\nMy master sues to her, and she hath\ntaught her suitor,\nHe being her pupil, to become her tutor.\nO excellent device! was there ever heard a better,\nThat my master, being scribe, to himself should write\nthe letter?\nNay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.\nTo be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.\nTo yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.\nBy a letter, I should say.\nWhat need she, when she hath made you write to\nyourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?\nNo believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive\nher earnest?\nWhy, she hath given you a letter.\nAnd that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.\nI'll warrant you, 'tis as well:\nFor often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,\nOr else for want of idle time, could not again reply;\nOr fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,\nHerself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.\nAll this I speak in print, for in print I found it.\nWhy muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.\nAy, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can\nfeed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my\nvictuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like\nyour mistress; be moved, be moved.\nMaster, Sir Thurio frowns on you.\nNot of you.\n'Twere good you knocked him.\nLaunce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!\nCome on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with you\npresently; where, for one shot of five pence, thou\nshalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how\ndid thy master part with Madam Julia?\nBut shall she marry him?\nHow then? shall he marry her?\nWhat, are they broken?\nWhy, then, how stands the matter with them?\nWhat an ass art thou! I understand thee not.\nWhat thou sayest?\nIt stands under thee, indeed.\nBut tell me true, will't be a match?\nThe conclusion is then that it will.\n'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest\nthou, that my master is become a notable lover?\nThan how?\nWhy, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.\nI tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.\nWhy?\nAt thy service.\nHow now, Signior Launce! what news with your\nmastership?\nWell, your old vice still; mistake the word. What\nnews, then, in your paper?\nWhy, man, how black?\nLet me read them.\nThou liest; I can.\nMarry, the son of my grandfather.\nCome, fool, come; try me in thy paper.\n'Imprimis: She can milk.'\n'Item: She brews good ale.'\n'Item: She can sew.'\n'Item: She can knit.'\n'Item: She can wash and scour.'\n'Item: She can spin.'\n'Item: She hath many nameless virtues.'\n'Here follow her vices.'\n'Item: She is not to be kissed fasting in respect\nof her breath.'\n'Item: She hath a sweet mouth.'\n'Item: She doth talk in her sleep.'\n'Item: She is slow in words.'\n'Item: She is proud.'\n'Item: She hath no teeth.'\n'Item: She is curst.'\n'Item: She will often praise her liquor.'\n'Item: She is too liberal.'\n'Item: She hath more hair than wit, and more faults\nthan hairs, and more wealth than faults.'\n'Item: She hath more hair than wit,'\xe2\x80\x94\n'And more faults than hairs,'\xe2\x80\x94\n'And more wealth than faults.'\nWhat then?\nFor me?\nAnd must I go to him?\nWhy didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love letters!\nSir, we are undone; these are the villains\nThat all the travellers do fear so much.\nMaster, be one of them; it's an honourable kind of thievery.\n", 'M'), ("Save you, fair queen!\nNo.\nAre you meditating on virginity?\nKeep him out.\nThere is none: man, sitting down before you, will\nundermine you and blow you up.\nVirginity being blown down, man will quicklier be\nblown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with\nthe breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It\nis not politic in the commonwealth of nature to\npreserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational\nincrease and there was never virgin got till\nvirginity was first lost. That you were made of is\nmetal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost\nmay be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is\never lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!\nThere's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the\nrule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,\nis to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible\ndisobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:\nvirginity murders itself and should be buried in\nhighways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate\noffendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,\nmuch like a cheese; consumes itself to the very\nparing, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.\nBesides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of\nself-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the\ncanon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose\nby't: out with 't! within ten year it will make\nitself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the\nprincipal itself not much the worse: away with 't!\nLet me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it\nlikes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with\nlying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't\nwhile 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.\nVirginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out\nof fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just\nlike the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not\nnow. Your date is better in your pie and your\nporridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,\nyour old virginity, is like one of our French\nwithered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,\n'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;\nmarry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?\nWhat one, i' faith?\nWhat's pity?\nLittle Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I\nwill think of thee at court.\nUnder Mars, I.\nWhy under Mars?\nWhen he was predominant.\nWhy think you so?\nThat's for advantage.\nI am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee\nacutely.

When\nthou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast\nnone, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,\nand use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.\n'Tis not his fault, the spark.\nMost admirable: I have seen those wars.\nAn thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.\nCommit it, count.\nNoble heroes, my sword and yours are kin.

Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his\nown getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest\ndeer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore\nblessed? No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village, so\nis the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare\nbrow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no\nskill, by so much is horn more precious than to want.

How old are you, friend?\nA ripe age. Is thy name William?\nA fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?\n'Thank God.' A good answer.\nArt rich?\n'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and\nyet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?\nWhy, thou say'st well. I do now remember a saying: 'The\nfool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be\na fool.' The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a\ngrape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning\nthereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do\nlove this maid?\nGive me your hand. Art thou learned?\nThen learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a\nfigure in rhetoric that drink, being pour'd out of cup into a\nglass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your\nwriters do consent that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse, for I\nam he.\nHe, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you\nclown, abandon- which is in the vulgar leave- the society- which\nin the boorish is company- of this female- which in the common is\nwoman- which together is: abandon the society of this female; or,\nclown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest;\nor, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into\ndeath, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee,\nor in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction;\nwill o'er-run thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred and\nfifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.\nTrip, Audrey, trip, Audrey. I attend, I attend.\nTo-morrow is the joyful day, Audrey; to-morrow will we\nbe married.\nBy my troth, well met. Come sit, sit, and a song.\nTruly, young gentlemen, though there was no great\nmatter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.\nBy my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear such\na foolish song. God buy you; and God mend your voices. Come,\nAudrey. \nSalutation and greeting to you all!\nIf any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.\nI have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been\npolitic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone\nthree tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought\none.\nFaith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the\nseventh cause.\nGod 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in\nhere, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear\nand to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A\npoor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a\npoor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will. Rich\nhonesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl\nin your foul oyster.\nAccording to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet\ndiseases.\nUpon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more\nseeming, Audrey- as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain\ncourtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was not\ncut well, he was in the mind it was. This is call'd the Retort\nCourteous. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would\nsend me word he cut it to please himself. This is call'd the Quip\nModest. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment.\nThis is call'd the Reply Churlish. If again it was not well cut,\nhe would answer I spake not true. This is call'd the Reproof\nValiant. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This\nis call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome. And so to the Lie\nCircumstantial and the Lie Direct.\nI durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor\nhe durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords\nand parted.\nO, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have\nbooks for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first,\nthe Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the\nReply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the\nCountercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance;\nthe seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie\nDirect; and you may avoid that too with an If.

Canidius, we\nWill fight with him by sea.\nFor that he dares us to't.\nBy sea, by sea.\nI'll fight at sea.\nOur overplus of shipping will we burn;\nAnd, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium\nBeat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,\nWe then can do't at land.\nThy business?\nCan he be there in person? 'tis impossible;\nStrange that power should be. Canidius,\nOur nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,\nAnd our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:\nAway, my Thetis!\nHow now, worthy soldier?\nWell, well: away!\nSet we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill,\nIn eye of Caesar's battle; from which place\nWe may the number of the ships behold,\nAnd so proceed accordingly.\nHark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;\nIt is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:\nI am so lated in the world, that I\nHave lost my way for ever: I have a ship\nLaden with gold; take that, divide it; fly,\nAnd make your peace with Caesar.\nI have fled myself; and have instructed cowards\nTo run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;\nI have myself resolved upon a course\nWhich has no need of you; be gone:\nMy treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,\nI follow'd that I blush to look upon:\nMy very hairs do mutiny; for the white\nReprove the brown for rashness, and they them\nFor fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall\nHave letters from me to some friends that will\nSweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,\nNor make replies of loathness: take the hint\nWhich my despair proclaims; let that be left\nWhich leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:\nI will possess you of that ship and treasure.\nLeave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:\nNay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,\nTherefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by.\nNo, no, no, no, no.\nO fie, fie, fie!\nYes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept\nHis sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck\nThe lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I\nThat the mad Brutus ended: he alone\nDealt on lieutenantry, and no practise had\nIn the brave squares of war: yet now\xe2\x80\x94No matter.\nI have offended reputation,\nA most unnoble swerving.\nO, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,\nHow I convey my shame out of thine eyes\nBy looking back what I have left behind\n'Stroy'd in dishonour.\nEgypt, thou knew'st too well\nMy heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,\nAnd thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit\nThy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that\nThy beck might from the bidding of the gods\nCommand me.\nNow I must\nTo the young man send humble treaties, dodge\nAnd palter in the shifts of lowness; who\nWith half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,\nMaking and marring fortunes. You did know\nHow much you were my conqueror; and that\nMy sword, made weak by my affection, would\nObey it on all cause.\nFall not a tear, I say; one of them rates\nAll that is won and lost: give me a kiss;\nEven this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;\nIs he come back? Love, I am full of lead.\nSome wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows\nWe scorn her most when most she offers blows.\nIs that his answer?\nThe queen shall then have courtesy, so she\nWill yield us up.\nLet her know't.\nTo the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,\nAnd he will fill thy wishes to the brim\nWith principalities.\nTo him again: tell him he wears the rose\nOf youth upon him; from which the world should note\nSomething particular: his coin, ships, legions,\nMay be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail\nUnder the service of a child as soon\nAs i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore\nTo lay his gay comparisons apart,\nAnd answer me declined, sword against sword,\nOurselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.\nFavours, by Jove that thunders!\nWhat art thou, fellow?\nApproach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods\nand devils!\nAuthority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'\nLike boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,\nAnd cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am\nAntony yet.\nTake hence this Jack, and whip him.\nMoon and stars!\nWhip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries\nThat do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them\nSo saucy with the hand of she here,\xe2\x80\x94what's her name,\nSince she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,\nTill, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,\nAnd whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.\nTug him away: being whipp'd,\nBring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall\nBear us an errand to him.\nYou were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!\nHave I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,\nForborne the getting of a lawful race,\nAnd by a gem of women, to be abused\nBy one that looks on feeders?\nYou have been a boggler ever:\nBut when we in our viciousness grow hard\xe2\x80\x94\nO misery on't!\xe2\x80\x94the wise gods seel our eyes;\nIn our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us\nAdore our errors; laugh at's, while we strut\nTo our confusion.\nI found you as a morsel cold upon\nDead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment\nOf Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,\nUnregister'd in vulgar fame, you have\nLuxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,\nThough you can guess what temperance should be,\nYou know not what it is.\nTo let a fellow that will take rewards\nAnd say 'God quit you!' be familiar with\nMy playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal\nAnd plighter of high hearts! O, that I were\nUpon the hill of Basan, to outroar\nThe horned herd! for I have savage cause;\nAnd to proclaim it civilly, were like\nA halter'd neck which does the hangman thank\nFor being yare about him.\nIs he whipp'd?\nCried he? and begg'd a' pardon?\nIf that thy father live, let him repent\nThou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry\nTo follow Caesar in his triumph, since\nThou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth\nThe white hand of a lady fever thee,\nShake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,\nTell him thy entertainment: look, thou say\nHe makes me angry with him; for he seems\nProud and disdainful, harping on what I am,\nNot what he knew I was: he makes me angry;\nAnd at this time most easy 'tis to do't,\nWhen my good stars, that were my former guides,\nHave empty left their orbs, and shot their fires\nInto the abysm of hell. If he mislike\nMy speech and what is done, tell him he has\nHipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom\nHe may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,\nAs he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:\nHence with thy stripes, begone!\nAlack, our terrene moon\nIs now eclipsed; and it portends alone\nThe fall of Antony!\nTo flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes\nWith one that ties his points?\nCold-hearted toward me?\nI am satisfied.\nCaesar sits down in Alexandria; where\nI will oppose his fate. Our force by land\nHath nobly held; our sever'd navy too\nHave knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.\nWhere hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?\nIf from the field I shall return once more\nTo kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;\nI and my sword will earn our chronicle:\nThere's hope in't yet.\nI will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,\nAnd fight maliciously: for when mine hours\nWere nice and lucky, men did ransom lives\nOf me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,\nAnd send to darkness all that stop me. Come,\nLet's have one other gaudy night: call to me\nAll my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;\nLet's mock the midnight bell.\nWe will yet do well.\nDo so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force\nThe wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;\nThere's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,\nI'll make death love me; for I will contend\nEven with his pestilent scythe.\nHe will not fight with me, Domitius.\nWhy should he not?\nTo-morrow, soldier,\nBy sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,\nOr bathe my dying honour in the blood\nShall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?\nWell said; come on.\nCall forth my household servants: let's to-night\nBe bounteous at our meal.\nGive me thy hand,\nThou hast been rightly honest;\xe2\x80\x94so hast thou;\xe2\x80\x94\nThou,\xe2\x80\x94and thou,\xe2\x80\x94and thou:\xe2\x80\x94you have served me well,\nAnd kings have been your fellows.\nAnd thou art honest too.\nI wish I could be made so many men,\nAnd all of you clapp'd up together in\nAn Antony, that I might do you service\nSo good as you have done.\nWell, my good fellows, wait on me to-night:\nScant not my cups; and make as much of me\nAs when mine empire was your fellow too,\nAnd suffer'd my command.\nTend me to-night;\nMay be it is the period of your duty:\nHaply you shall not see me more; or if,\nA mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow\nYou'll serve another master. I look on you\nAs one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,\nI turn you not away; but, like a master\nMarried to your good service, stay till death:\nTend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,\nAnd the gods yield you for't!\nHo, ho, ho!\nNow the witch take me, if I meant it thus!\nGrace grow where those drops fall!\nMy hearty friends,\nYou take me in too dolorous a sense;\nFor I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you\nTo burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,\nI hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you\nWhere rather I'll expect victorious life\nThan death and honour. Let's to supper, come,\nAnd drown consideration.\nEros! mine armour, Eros!\nNo, my chuck. Eros, come; mine armour, Eros!\nCome good fellow, put mine iron on:\nIf fortune be not ours to-day, it is\nBecause we brave her: come.\nAh, let be, let be! thou art\nThe armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this.\nWell, well;\nWe shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?\nGo put on thy defences.\nRarely, rarely:\nHe that unbuckles this, till we do please\nTo daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.\nThou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire\nMore tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love,\nThat thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st\nThe royal occupation! thou shouldst see\nA workman in't.\nGood morrow to thee; welcome:\nThou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:\nTo business that we love we rise betime,\nAnd go to't with delight.\n'Tis well blown, lads:\nThis morning, like the spirit of a youth\nThat means to be of note, begins betimes.\nSo, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.\nFare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me:\nThis is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable\nAnd worthy shameful cheque it were, to stand\nOn more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee\nNow, like a man of steel. You that will fight,\nFollow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.\nWould thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd\nTo make me fight at land!\nWho's gone this morning?\nWhat say'st thou?\nIs he gone?\nGo, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;\nDetain no jot, I charge thee: write to him\xe2\x80\x94\nI will subscribe\xe2\x80\x94gentle adieus and greetings;\nSay that I wish he never find more cause\nTo change a master. O, my fortunes have\nCorrupted honest men! Dispatch.\xe2\x80\x94Enobarbus!\nThou bleed'st apace.\nThey do retire.\nI will reward thee\nOnce for thy spritely comfort, and ten-fold\nFor thy good valour. Come thee on.\nWe have beat him to his camp: run one before,\nAnd let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,\nBefore the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood\nThat has to-day escaped. I thank you all;\nFor doughty-handed are you, and have fought\nNot as you served the cause, but as 't had been\nEach man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.\nEnter the city, clip your wives, your friends,\nTell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears\nWash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss\nThe honour'd gashes whole.\nGive me thy hand\nTo this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,\nMake her thanks bless thee.\nO thou day o' the world,\nChain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all,\nThrough proof of harness to my heart, and there\nRide on the pants triumphing!\nMy nightingale,\nWe have beat them to their beds. What, girl!\nthough grey\nDo something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we\nA brain that nourishes our nerves, and can\nGet goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;\nCommend unto his lips thy favouring hand:\nKiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day\nAs if a god, in hate of mankind, had\nDestroy'd in such a shape.\nHe has deserved it, were it carbuncled\nLike holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:\nThrough Alexandria make a jolly march;\nBear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:\nHad our great palace the capacity\nTo camp this host, we all would sup together,\nAnd drink carouses to the next day's fate,\nWhich promises royal peril. Trumpeters,\nWith brazen din blast you the city's ear;\nMake mingle with rattling tabourines;\nThat heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,\nApplauding our approach.\nTheir preparation is to-day by sea;\nWe please them not by land.\nI would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air;\nWe'ld fight there too. But this it is; our foot\nUpon the hills adjoining to the city\nShall stay with us: order for sea is given;\nThey have put forth the haven\nWhere their appointment we may best discover,\nAnd look on their endeavour.\nYet they are not join'd: where yond pine\ndoes stand,\nI shall discover all: I'll bring thee word\nStraight, how 'tis like to go.\nAll is lost;\nThis foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:\nMy fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder\nThey cast their caps up and carouse together\nLike friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!\n'tis thou\nHast sold me to this novice; and my heart\nMakes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;\nFor when I am revenged upon my charm,\nI have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.\nO sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:\nFortune and Antony part here; even here\nDo we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts\nThat spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave\nTheir wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets\nOn blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,\nThat overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:\nO this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,\xe2\x80\x94\nWhose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;\nWhose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,\xe2\x80\x94\nLike a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,\nBeguiled me to the very heart of loss.\nWhat, Eros, Eros!\nAh, thou spell! Avaunt!\nVanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,\nAnd blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee,\nAnd hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians:\nFollow his chariot, like the greatest spot\nOf all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown\nFor poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let\nPatient Octavia plough thy visage up\nWith her prepared nails.\n'Tis well thou'rt gone,\nIf it be well to live; but better 'twere\nThou fell'st into my fury, for one death\nMight have prevented many. Eros, ho!\nThe shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,\nAlcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage:\nLet me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;\nAnd with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,\nSubdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:\nTo the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall\nUnder this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho!\nEros, thou yet behold'st me?\nSometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;\nA vapour sometime like a bear or lion,\nA tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,\nA forked mountain, or blue promontory\nWith trees upon't, that nod unto the world,\nAnd mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen\nthese signs;\nThey are black vesper's pageants.\nThat which is now a horse, even with a thought\nThe rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,\nAs water is in water.\nMy good knave Eros, now thy captain is\nEven such a body: here I am Antony:\nYet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.\nI made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,\xe2\x80\x94\nWhose heart I thought I had, for she had mine;\nWhich whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't\nA million more, now lost,\xe2\x80\x94she, Eros, has\nPack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory\nUnto an enemy's triumph.\nNay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us\nOurselves to end ourselves.\nO! thy vile lady!\nShe has robb'd me of my sword.\nHence, saucy eunuch; peace!\nShe hath betray'd me and shall die the death.\nDead, then?\nUnarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,\nAnd we must sleep.\nThat thou depart'st hence safe,\nDoes pay thy labour richly; go.\nOff, pluck off:\nThe seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep\nThe battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!\nHeart, once be stronger than thy continent,\nCrack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.\nNo more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;\nYou have been nobly borne. From me awhile.\nI will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and\nWeep for my pardon. So it must be, for now\nAll length is torture: since the torch is out,\nLie down, and stray no farther: now all labour\nMars what it does; yea, very force entangles\nItself with strength: seal then, and all is done.\nEros!\xe2\x80\x94I come, my queen:\xe2\x80\x94Eros!\xe2\x80\x94Stay for me:\nWhere souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,\nAnd with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:\nDido and her AEneas shall want troops,\nAnd all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!\nSince Cleopatra died,\nI have lived in such dishonour, that the gods\nDetest my baseness. I, that with my sword\nQuarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back\nWith ships made cities, condemn myself to lack\nThe courage of a woman; less noble mind\nThan she which by her death our Caesar tells\n'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,\nThat, when the exigent should come, which now\nIs come indeed, when I should see behind me\nThe inevitable prosecution of\nDisgrace and horror, that, on my command,\nThou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:\nThou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.\nPut colour in thy cheek.\nEros,\nWouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see\nThy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down\nHis corrigible neck, his face subdued\nTo penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat\nOf fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded\nHis baseness that ensued?\nCome, then; for with a wound I must be cured.\nDraw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn\nMost useful for thy country.\nWhen I did make thee free, sworest thou not then\nTo do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;\nOr thy precedent services are all\nBut accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.\nLo thee!\nThen let it do at once\nThe thing why thou hast drawn it.\n'Tis said, man; and farewell.\nNow, Eros.\nThrice-nobler than myself!\nThou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what\nI should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros\nHave by their brave instruction got upon me\nA nobleness in record: but I will be\nA bridegroom in my death, and run into't\nAs to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,\nThy master dies thy scholar: to do thus\nI learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?\nThe guard, ho! O, dispatch me!\nI have done my work in, friends: O, make an end\nOf what I have begun.\nLet him that loves me strike me dead.\nArt thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me\nSufficing strokes for death.\nWhen did she send thee?\nWhere is she?\nToo late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee.\nBear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;\n'Tis the last service that I shall command you.\nNay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate\nTo grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome\nWhich comes to punish us, and we punish it\nSeeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:\nI have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,\nAnd have my thanks for all.\nPeace!\nNot Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,\nBut Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.\nI am dying, Egypt, dying; only\nI here importune death awhile, until\nOf many thousand kisses the poor last\nI lay up thy lips.\nO, quick, or I am gone.\nI am dying, Egypt, dying:\nGive me some wine, and let me speak a little.\nOne word, sweet queen:\nOf Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!\nGentle, hear me:\nNone about Caesar trust but Proculeius.\nThe miserable change now at my end\nLament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts\nIn feeding them with those my former fortunes\nWherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,\nThe noblest; and do now not basely die,\nNot cowardly put off my helmet to\nMy countryman,\xe2\x80\x94a Roman by a Roman\nValiantly vanquish'd.

Now I feel\nOf what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy:\nHow eagerly ye follow my disgraces,\nAs if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton\nYe appear in every thing may bring my ruin!\nFollow your envious courses, men of malice;\nYou have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt,\nIn time will find their fit rewards. That seal,\nYou ask with such a violence, the king,\nMine and your master, with his own hand gave me;\nBade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,\nDuring my life; and, to confirm his goodness,\nTied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?\nIt must be himself, then.\nProud lord, thou liest:\nWithin these forty hours Surrey durst better\nHave burnt that tongue than said so.\nThis, and all else\nThis talking lord can lay upon my credit,\nI answer is most false. The duke by law\nFound his deserts: how innocent I was\nFrom any private malice in his end,\nHis noble jury and foul cause can witness.\nIf I loved many words, lord, I should tell you\nYou have as little honesty as honour,\nThat in the way of loyalty and truth\nToward the king, my ever royal master,\nDare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,\nAnd all that love his follies.\nAll goodness\nIs poison to thy stomach.\nHow much, methinks, I could despise this man,\nBut that I am bound in charity against it!\nSo much fairer\nAnd spotless shall mine innocence arise,\nWhen the king knows my truth.\nSpeak on, sir;\nI dare your worst objections: if I blush,\nIt is to see a nobleman want manners.\nSo farewell to the little good you bear me.\nFarewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!\nThis is the state of man: to-day he puts forth\nThe tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,\nAnd bears his blushing honours thick upon him;\nThe third day comes a frost, a killing frost,\nAnd, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely\nHis greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,\nAnd then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,\nLike little wanton boys that swim on bladders,\nThis many summers in a sea of glory,\nBut far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride\nAt length broke under me and now has left me,\nWeary and old with service, to the mercy\nOf a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.\nVain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:\nI feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched\nIs that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!\nThere is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,\nThat sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,\nMore pangs and fears than wars or women have:\nAnd when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,\nNever to hope again.\nWhy, how now, Cromwell!\nWhat, amazed\nAt my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder\nA great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,\nI am fall'n indeed.\nWhy, well;\nNever so truly happy, my good Cromwell.\nI know myself now; and I feel within me\nA peace above all earthly dignities,\nA still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,\nI humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,\nThese ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken\nA load would sink a navy, too much honour:\nO, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthen\nToo heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!\nI hope I have: I am able now, methinks,\nOut of a fortitude of soul I feel,\nTo endure more miseries and greater far\nThan my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.\nWhat news abroad?\nGod bless him!\nThat's somewhat sudden:\nBut he's a learned man. May he continue\nLong in his highness' favour, and do justice\nFor truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,\nWhen he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,\nMay have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em! What more?\nThat's news indeed.\nThere was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,\nThe king has gone beyond me: all my glories\nIn that one woman I have lost for ever:\nNo sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,\nOr gild again the noble troops that waited\nUpon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;\nI am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now\nTo be thy lord and master: seek the king;\nThat sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him\nWhat and how true thou art: he will advance thee;\nSome little memory of me will stir him\xe2\x80\x94\nI know his noble nature\xe2\x80\x94not to let\nThy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,\nNeglect him not; make use now, and provide\nFor thine own future safety.\nCromwell, I did not think to shed a tear\nIn all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,\nOut of thy honest truth, to play the woman.\nLet's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;\nAnd, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,\nAnd sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention\nOf me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,\nSay, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,\nAnd sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,\nFound thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;\nA sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.\nMark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.\nCromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:\nBy that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,\nThe image of his Maker, hope to win by it?\nLove thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;\nCorruption wins not more than honesty.\nStill in thy right hand carry gentle peace,\nTo silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:\nLet all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,\nThy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st,\nO Cromwell,\nThou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;\nAnd,\xe2\x80\x94prithee, lead me in:\nThere take an inventory of all I have,\nTo the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,\nAnd my integrity to heaven, is all\nI dare now call mine own.

Speak sad brow and true\nmaid.\nOrlando?\nAlas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?\nWhat did he when thou saw'st him? What said he? How look'd he?\nWherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where\nremains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him\nagain? Answer me in one word.\nBut doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's\napparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?\nIt may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops forth\nsuch fruit.\nProceed.\nThough it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes\nthe ground.\nO, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.\nDo you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak.\nSweet, say on.\n'Tis he; slink by, and note him.\nI will speak to him like a saucy lackey,\nand under that habit play the knave with him.- Do you hear,\nforester?\nI pray you, what is't o'clock?\nThen there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing\nevery minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot\nof Time as well as a clock.\nBy no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with\ndivers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time\ntrots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still\nwithal.\nMarry, he trots hard with a young maid between the\ncontract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd; if the\ninterim be but a se'nnight, Time's pace is so hard that it seems\nthe length of seven year.\nWith a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath\nnot the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study,\nand the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one\nlacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other\nknowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These Time ambles\nwithal.\nWith a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly\nas foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.\nWith lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term\nand term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.\nWith this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of\nthe forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.\nAs the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.\nI have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious\nuncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland\nman; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love.\nI have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank God I\nam not a woman, to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he\nhath generally tax'd their whole sex withal.\nThere were none principal; they were all like one another\nas halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his\nfellow-fault came to match it.\nNo; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are\nsick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young\nplants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes upon\nhawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the\nname of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give\nhim some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love\nupon him.\nThere is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me\nhow to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure you\nare not prisoner.\nA lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,\nwhich you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not;\na beard neglected, which you have not; but I pardon you for that,\nfor simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue.\nThen your hose should be ungarter'd, your bonnet unbanded, your\nsleeve unbutton'd, your shoe untied, and every thing about you\ndemonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man; you\nare rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself\nthan seeming the lover of any other.\nMe believe it! You may as soon make her that you love\nbelieve it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess\nshe does. That is one of the points in the which women still give\nthe lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that\nhangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?\nBut are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?\nLove is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as\nwell a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why\nthey are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so\nordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing\nit by counsel.\nYes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his\nlove, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me; at which\ntime would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate,\nchangeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish,\nshallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every\npassion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and\nwomen are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like\nhim, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now\nweep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his\nmad humour of love to a living humour of madness; which was, to\nforswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook\nmerely monastic. And thus I cur'd him; and this way will I take\nupon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart,\nthat there shall not be one spot of love in 't.\nI would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and\ncome every day to my cote and woo me.\nGo with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,\nyou shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?\nNay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you\ngo? \nNever talk to me; I will weep.\nBut have I not cause to weep?\nHis very hair is of the dissembling colour.\nI' faith, his hair is of a good colour.\nAnd his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of\nholy bread.\nBut why did he swear he would come this morning, and\ncomes not?\nDo you think so?\nNot true in love?\nYou have heard him swear downright he was.\nI met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.\nHe asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good as\nhe; so he laugh'd and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when\nthere is such a man as Orlando?\nO, come, let us remove!\nThe sight of lovers feedeth those in love.\nBring us to this sight, and you shall say\nI'll prove a busy actor in their play. \nAnd why, I pray you? Who might be your\nmother,\nThat you insult, exult, and all at once,\nOver the wretched? What though you have no beauty-\nAs, by my faith, I see no more in you\nThan without candle may go dark to bed-\nMust you be therefore proud and pitiless?\nWhy, what means this? Why do you look on me?\nI see no more in you than in the ordinary\nOf nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,\nI think she means to tangle my eyes too!\nNo faith, proud mistress, hope not after it;\n'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,\nYour bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,\nThat can entame my spirits to your worship.\nYou foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,\nLike foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?\nYou are a thousand times a properer man\nThan she a woman. 'Tis such fools as you\nThat makes the world full of ill-favour'd children.\n'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;\nAnd out of you she sees herself more proper\nThan any of her lineaments can show her.\nBut, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees,\nAnd thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;\nFor I must tell you friendly in your ear:\nSell when you can; you are not for all markets.\nCry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;\nFoul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.\nSo take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.\nHe's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall\nin love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee\nwith frowning looks, I'll sauce her with bitter words. Why look\nyou so upon me?\nI pray you do not fall in love with me,\nFor I am falser than vows made in wine;\nBesides, I like you not. If you will know my house,\n'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.\nWill you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.\nCome, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,\nAnd be not proud; though all the world could see,\nNone could be so abus'd in sight as he.\nCome, to our flock.  ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN\nThey say you are a melancholy fellow.\nThose that are in extremity of either are abominable\nfellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than\ndrunkards.\nWhy then, 'tis good to be a post.\nA traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be\nsad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then\nto have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and\npoor hands.\nAnd your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a\nfool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to\ntravel for it too.\nFarewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear\nstrange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be\nout of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making\nyou that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have\nswam in a gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where\nhave you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such\nanother trick, never come in my sight more.\nBreak an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a\nminute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the\nthousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said\nof him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder, but I'll\nwarrant him heart-whole.\nNay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had\nas lief be woo'd of a snail.\nAy, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries\nhis house on his head- a better jointure, I think, than you make\na woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.\nWhy, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to\nyour wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents\nthe slander of his wife.\nAnd I am your Rosalind.\nCome, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,\nand like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I\nwere your very very Rosalind?\nNay, you were better speak first; and when you were\ngravell'd for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.\nVery good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for\nlovers lacking- God warn us!- matter, the cleanliest shift is to\nkiss.\nThen she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new\nmatter.\nMarry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I\nshould think my honesty ranker than my wit.\nNot out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.\nAm not I your Rosalind?\nWell, in her person, I say I will not have you.\nNo, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six\nthousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man\ndied in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had\nhis brains dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he\ncould to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love.\nLeander, he would have liv'd many a fair year, though Hero had\nturn'd nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for,\ngood youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and,\nbeing taken with the cramp, was drown'd; and the foolish\nchroniclers of that age found it was- Hero of Sestos. But these\nare all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have\neaten them, but not for love.\nBy this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I\nwill be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me\nwhat you will, I will grant it.\nYes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.\nAy, and twenty such.\nAre you not good?\nWhy then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,\nsister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. Give me your hand,\nOrlando. What do you say, sister?\nYou must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-\nAy, but when?\nThen you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'\nI might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,\nOrlando, for my husband. There's a girl goes before the priest;\nand, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions.\nNow tell me how long you would have her, after you have\npossess'd her.\nSay 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are\nApril when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May when\nthey are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will\nbe more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,\nmore clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than\nan ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for\nnothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you\nare dispos'd to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when\nthou are inclin'd to sleep.\nBy my life, she will do as I do.\nOr else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,\nthe waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out\nat the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop\nthat, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.\nNay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your\nwife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.\nMarry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never\ntake her without her answer, unless you take her without her\ntongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's\noccasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will\nbreed it like a fool!\nAlas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!\nAy, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would\nprove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That\nflattering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and\nso, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?\nBy my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and\nby all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot\nof your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will\nthink you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow\nlover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may\nbe chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore\nbeware my censure, and keep your promise.\nWell, Time is the old justice that examines all such\noffenders, and let Time try. Adieu. \nO coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst\nknow how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded;\nmy affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.\nNo; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of\nthought, conceiv'd of spleen, and born of madness; that blind\nrascally boy, that abuses every one's eyes, because his own are\nout- let him be judge how deep I am in love. I'll tell thee,\nAliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I'll go find a\nshadow, and sigh till he come.\nHow say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?\nAnd here much Orlando!\nPatience herself would startle at this letter,\nAnd play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.\nShe says I am not fair, that I lack manners;\nShe calls me proud, and that she could not love me,\nWere man as rare as Phoenix. 'Od's my will!\nHer love is not the hare that I do hunt;\nWhy writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,\nThis is a letter of your own device.\nCome, come, you are a fool,\nAnd turn'd into the extremity of love.\nI saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,\nA freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think\nThat her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands;\nShe has a huswife's hand- but that's no matter.\nI say she never did invent this letter:\nThis is a man's invention, and his hand.\nWhy, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;\nA style for challengers. Why, she defies me,\nLike Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain\nCould not drop forth such giant-rude invention,\nSuch Ethiope words, blacker in their effect\nThan in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?\nShe Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.\n'Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,\nThat a maiden's heart hath burn'd?'\nCan a woman rail thus?\n'Why, thy godhead laid apart,\nWarr'st thou with a woman's heart?'\nDid you ever hear such railing?\n'Whiles the eye of man did woo me,\nThat could do no vengeance to me.'\nMeaning me a beast.\n'If the scorn of your bright eyne\nHave power to raise such love in mine,\nAlack, in me what strange effect\nWould they work in mild aspect!\nWhiles you chid me, I did love;\nHow then might your prayers move!\nHe that brings this love to the\nLittle knows this love in me;\nAnd by him seal up thy mind,\nWhether that thy youth and kind\nWill the faithful offer take\nOf me and all that I can make;\nOr else by him my love deny,\nAnd then I'll study how to die.'\nDo you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love\nsuch a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false\nstrains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,\nfor I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-\nthat if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,\nI will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a\ntrue lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.\nI am. What must we understand by this?\nBut, to Orlando: did he leave him there,\nFood to the suck'd and hungry lioness?\nWas't you he rescu'd?\nBut for the bloody napkin?\nI would I were at home.\nI do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think\nthis was well counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how\nwell I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!\nCounterfeit, I assure you.\nSo I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by\nright.\nI shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my\ncounterfeiting to him. Will you go? \nGod save you, brother.\nO, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear\nthy heart in a scarf!\nI thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a\nlion.\nDid your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon\nwhen he show'd me your handkercher?\nO, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never\nany thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar's\nthrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and overcame.' For your brother\nand my sister no sooner met but they look'd; no sooner look'd but\nthey lov'd; no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd; no sooner sigh'd but\nthey ask'd one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but\nthey sought the remedy- and in these degrees have they made pair\nof stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else\nbe incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of\nlove, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.\nWhy, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for\nRosalind?\nI will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking. Know\nof me then- for now I speak to some purpose- that I know you are\na gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should\nbear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you\nare; neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some\nlittle measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and\nnot to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do\nstrange things. I have, since I was three year old, convers'd\nwith a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable.\nIf you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries\nit out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her. I\nknow into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not\nimpossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set\nher before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without any\ndanger.\nBy my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I\nam a magician. Therefore put you in your best array, bid your\nfriends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall; and to\nRosalind, if you will.\nLook, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.\nI care not if I have. It is my study\nTo seem despiteful and ungentle to you.\nYou are there follow'd by a faithful shepherd;\nLook upon him, love him; he worships you.\nAnd I for no woman.\nAnd I for no woman.\nAnd so am I for no woman.\nWhy do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?'\nPray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish\nwolves against the moon. I will help you if I can.\nI would love you if I could.- To-morrow meet me all\ntogether. I will marry you if ever I marry woman,\nand I'll be married to-morrow. I will satisfy you if\never I satisfied man, and you shall be married to-morrow. \nI will content you if what pleases you contents you, and\nyou shall be married to-morrow. As you love\nRosalind, meet. As you love Phebe, meet;- and as I\nlove no woman, I'll meet. So, fare you well; I have left you\ncommands.\nPatience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd:\nYou say, if I bring in your Rosalind,\nYou will bestow her on Orlando here?\nAnd you say you will have her when I bring her?\nYou say you'll marry me, if I be willing?\nBut if you do refuse to marry me,\nYou'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?\nYou say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?\nI have promis'd to make all this matter even.\nKeep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter;\nYou yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter;\nKeep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,\nOr else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd;\nKeep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her\nIf she refuse me; and from hence I go,\nTo make these doubts all even.\nTo you I give myself, for I am yours.\nTo you I give myself, for I am yours.\nI'll have no father, if you be not he;\nI'll have no husband, if you be not he;\nNor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.\nIt is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but\nit is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it\nbe true that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play\nneeds no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and\ngood plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a\ncase am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot\ninsinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not\nfurnish'd like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My\nway is to conjure you; and I'll begin with the women. I charge\nyou, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of\nthis play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love\nyou bear to women- as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you\nhates them- that between you and the women the play may please.\nIf I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that\npleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defied\nnot; and, I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces,\nor sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,\nbid me farewell.\n", 'F'), ("I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia\nmeans to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.\nBeseech you,\xe2\x80\x94\nYou pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.\nSicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.\nThey were trained together in their childhoods; and\nthere rooted betwixt them then such an affection,\nwhich cannot choose but branch now. Since their\nmore mature dignities and royal necessities made\nseparation of their society, their encounters,\nthough not personal, have been royally attorneyed\nwith interchange of gifts, letters, loving\nembassies; that they have seemed to be together,\nthough absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and\nembraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed\nwinds. The heavens continue their loves!\nI very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it\nis a gallant child; one that indeed physics the\nsubject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on\ncrutches ere he was born desire yet their life to\nsee him a man.\nYes; if there were no other excuse why they should\ndesire to live.\nAy, my good lord.\nYou had much ado to make his anchor hold:\nWhen you cast out, it still came home.\nHe would not stay at your petitions: made\nHis business more material.\nAt the good queen's entreaty.\nBusiness, my lord! I think most understand\nBohemia stays here longer.\nStays here longer.\nTo satisfy your highness and the entreaties\nOf our most gracious mistress.\nBe it forbid, my lord!\nMy gracious lord,\nI may be negligent, foolish and fearful;\nIn every one of these no man is free,\nBut that his negligence, his folly, fear,\nAmong the infinite doings of the world,\nSometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,\nIf ever I were wilful-negligent,\nIt was my folly; if industriously\nI play'd the fool, it was my negligence,\nNot weighing well the end; if ever fearful\nTo do a thing, where I the issue doubted,\nWhere of the execution did cry out\nAgainst the non-performance, 'twas a fear\nWhich oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,\nAre such allow'd infirmities that honesty\nIs never free of. But, beseech your grace,\nBe plainer with me; let me know my trespass\nBy its own visage: if I then deny it,\n'Tis none of mine.\nI would not be a stander-by to hear\nMy sovereign mistress clouded so, without\nMy present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,\nYou never spoke what did become you less\nThan this; which to reiterate were sin\nAs deep as that, though true.\nGood my lord, be cured\nOf this diseased opinion, and betimes;\nFor 'tis most dangerous.\nNo, no, my lord.\nWho does infect her?\nSir, my lord,\nI could do this, and that with no rash potion,\nBut with a lingering dram that should not work\nMaliciously like poison: but I cannot\nBelieve this crack to be in my dread mistress,\nSo sovereignly being honourable.\nI have loved thee,\xe2\x80\x94\nI must believe you, sir:\nI do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;\nProvided that, when he's removed, your highness\nWill take again your queen as yours at first,\nEven for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing\nThe injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms\nKnown and allied to yours.\nMy lord,\nGo then; and with a countenance as clear\nAs friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia\nAnd with your queen. I am his cupbearer:\nIf from me he have wholesome beverage,\nAccount me not your servant.\nI'll do't, my lord.\nO miserable lady! But, for me,\nWhat case stand I in? I must be the poisoner\nOf good Polixenes; and my ground to do't\nIs the obedience to a master, one\nWho in rebellion with himself will have\nAll that are his so too. To do this deed,\nPromotion follows. If I could find example\nOf thousands that had struck anointed kings\nAnd flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since\nNor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,\nLet villany itself forswear't. I must\nForsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain\nTo me a break-neck.

Come, sir, away.\nIt is fifteen years since I saw my country: though\nI have for the most part been aired abroad, I\ndesire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent\nking, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling\nsorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to\nthink so, which is another spur to my departure.\nSir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What\nhis happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I\nhave missingly noted, he is of late much retired\nfrom court and is less frequent to his princely\nexercises than formerly he hath appeared.\nI have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a\ndaughter of most rare note: the report of her is\nextended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.\nI willingly obey your command.\nI should leave grazing, were I of your flock,\nAnd only live by gazing.\nHe tells her something\nThat makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is\nThe queen of curds and cream.\nThis shows a sound affection.\nWhy, how now, father!\nSpeak ere thou diest.\nGracious my lord,\nYou know your father's temper: at this time\nHe will allow no speech, which I do guess\nYou do not purpose to him; and as hardly\nWill he endure your sight as yet, I fear:\nThen, till the fury of his highness settle,\nCome not before him.\nEven he, my lord.\nBe advised.\nThis is desperate, sir.\nO my lord!\nI would your spirit were easier for advice,\nOr stronger for your need.\nHe's irremoveable,\nResolved for flight. Now were I happy, if\nHis going I could frame to serve my turn,\nSave him from danger, do him love and honour,\nPurchase the sight again of dear Sicilia\nAnd that unhappy king, my master, whom\nI so much thirst to see.\nSir, I think\nYou have heard of my poor services, i' the love\nThat I have borne your father?\nWell, my lord,\nIf you may please to think I love the king\nAnd through him what is nearest to him, which is\nYour gracious self, embrace but my direction:\nIf your more ponderous and settled project\nMay suffer alteration, on mine honour,\nI'll point you where you shall have such receiving\nAs shall become your highness; where you may\nEnjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,\nThere's no disjunction to be made, but by\xe2\x80\x94\nAs heavens forefend!\xe2\x80\x94your ruin; marry her,\nAnd, with my best endeavours in your absence,\nYour discontenting father strive to qualify\nAnd bring him up to liking.\nHave you thought on\nA place whereto you'll go?\nThen list to me:\nThis follows, if you will not change your purpose\nBut undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,\nAnd there present yourself and your fair princess,\nFor so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:\nShe shall be habited as it becomes\nThe partner of your bed. Methinks I see\nLeontes opening his free arms and weeping\nHis welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,\nAs 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands\nOf your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him\n'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one\nHe chides to hell and bids the other grow\nFaster than thought or time.\nSent by the king your father\nTo greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,\nThe manner of your bearing towards him, with\nWhat you as from your father shall deliver,\nThings known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:\nThe which shall point you forth at every sitting\nWhat you must say; that he shall not perceive\nBut that you have your father's bosom there\nAnd speak his very heart.\nA cause more promising\nThan a wild dedication of yourselves\nTo unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain\nTo miseries enough; no hope to help you,\nBut as you shake off one to take another;\nNothing so certain as your anchors, who\nDo their best office, if they can but stay you\nWhere you'll be loath to be: besides you know\nProsperity's the very bond of love,\nWhose fresh complexion and whose heart together\nAffliction alters.\nYea, say you so?\nThere shall not at your father's house these\nseven years\nBe born another such.\nI cannot say 'tis pity\nShe lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress\nTo most that teach.\nMy lord,\nFear none of this: I think you know my fortunes\nDo all lie there: it shall be so my care\nTo have you royally appointed as if\nThe scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,\nThat you may know you shall not want, one word.\nNay, but my letters, by this means being there\nSo soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.\nShall satisfy your father.\nWho have we here?\nWe'll make an instrument of this, omit\nNothing may give us aid.\nHow now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear\nnot, man; here's no harm intended to thee.\nWhy, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from\nthee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must\nmake an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,\n\xe2\x80\x94thou must think there's a necessity in't,\xe2\x80\x94and\nchange garments with this gentleman: though the\npennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,\nthere's some boot.\nNay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half\nflayed already.\nUnbuckle, unbuckle.\nFortunate mistress,\xe2\x80\x94let my prophecy\nCome home to ye!\xe2\x80\x94you must retire yourself\nInto some covert: take your sweetheart's hat\nAnd pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,\nDismantle you, and, as you can, disliken\nThe truth of your own seeming; that you may\xe2\x80\x94\nFor I do fear eyes over\xe2\x80\x94to shipboard\nGet undescried.\nNo remedy.\nHave you done there?\nNay, you shall have no hat.\nCome, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.\nWhat I do next, shall be to tell the king\nOf this escape and whither they are bound;\nWherein my hope is I shall so prevail\nTo force him after: in whose company\nI shall review Sicilia, for whose sight\nI have a woman's longing.\nThe swifter speed the better.\nMy lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,\nWhich sixteen winters cannot blow away,\nSo many summers dry; scarce any joy\nDid ever so long live; no sorrow\nBut kill'd itself much sooner.\nShe hangs about his neck:\nIf she pertain to life let her speak too.\n", 'M'), ("I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until\nYou have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,\nCharge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure\nAll in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction\nThe by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,\nHe's beat from his best ward.\nTo tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:\nBut let him say so then, and let him go;\nBut let him swear so, and he shall not stay,\nWe'll thwack him hence with distaffs.\nYet of your royal presence I'll adventure\nThe borrow of a week. When at Bohemia\nYou take my lord, I'll give him my commission\nTo let him there a month behind the gest\nPrefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,\nI love thee not a jar o' the clock behind\nWhat lady-she her lord. You'll stay?\nNay, but you will?\nVerily!\nYou put me off with limber vows; but I,\nThough you would seek to unsphere the\nstars with oaths,\nShould yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,\nYou shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's\nAs potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?\nForce me to keep you as a prisoner,\nNot like a guest; so you shall pay your fees\nWhen you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?\nMy prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'\nOne of them you shall be.\nNot your gaoler, then,\nBut your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you\nOf my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:\nYou were pretty lordings then?\nWas not my lord\nThe verier wag o' the two?\nBy this we gather\nYou have tripp'd since.\nGrace to boot!\nOf this make no conclusion, lest you say\nYour queen and I are devils: yet go on;\nThe offences we have made you do we'll answer,\nIf you first sinn'd with us and that with us\nYou did continue fault and that you slipp'd not\nWith any but with us.\nHe'll stay my lord.\nNever?\nWhat! have I twice said well? when was't before?\nI prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's\nAs fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless\nSlaughters a thousand waiting upon that.\nOur praises are our wages: you may ride's\nWith one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere\nWith spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:\nMy last good deed was to entreat his stay:\nWhat was my first? it has an elder sister,\nOr I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!\nBut once before I spoke to the purpose: when?\nNay, let me have't; I long.\n'Tis grace indeed.\nWhy, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:\nThe one for ever earn'd a royal husband;\nThe other for some while a friend.\nHe something seems unsettled.\nYou look as if you held a brow of much distraction\nAre you moved, my lord?\nIf you would seek us,\nWe are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?\nTake the boy to you: he so troubles me,\n'Tis past enduring.\nWhat wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now\nI am for you again: pray you, sit by us,\nAnd tell 's a tale.\nAs merry as you will.\nLet's have that, good sir.\nCome on, sit down: come on, and do your best\nTo fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.\nNay, come, sit down; then on.\nCome on, then,\nAnd give't me in mine ear.\nWhat is this? sport?\nBut I'ld say he had not,\nAnd I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,\nHowe'er you lean to the nayward.\nShould a villain say so,\nThe most replenish'd villain in the world,\nHe were as much more villain: you, my lord,\nDo but mistake.\nNo, by my life.\nPrivy to none of this. How will this grieve you,\nWhen you shall come to clearer knowledge, that\nYou thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,\nYou scarce can right me throughly then to say\nYou did mistake.\nThere's some ill planet reigns:\nI must be patient till the heavens look\nWith an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,\nI am not prone to weeping, as our sex\nCommonly are; the want of which vain dew\nPerchance shall dry your pities: but I have\nThat honourable grief lodged here which burns\nWorse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,\nWith thoughts so qualified as your charities\nShall best instruct you, measure me; and so\nThe king's will be perform'd!\nWho is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,\nMy women may be with me; for you see\nMy plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;\nThere is no cause: when you shall know your mistress\nHas deserved prison, then abound in tears\nAs I come out: this action I now go on\nIs for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:\nI never wish'd to see you sorry; now\nI trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.\nSince what I am to say must be but that\nWhich contradicts my accusation and\nThe testimony on my part no other\nBut what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me\nTo say 'not guilty:' mine integrity\nBeing counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,\nBe so received. But thus: if powers divine\nBehold our human actions, as they do,\nI doubt not then but innocence shall make\nFalse accusation blush and tyranny\nTremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,\nWho least will seem to do so, my past life\nHath been as continent, as chaste, as true,\nAs I am now unhappy; which is more\nThan history can pattern, though devised\nAnd play'd to take spectators. For behold me\nA fellow of the royal bed, which owe\nA moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,\nThe mother to a hopeful prince, here standing\nTo prate and talk for life and honour 'fore\nWho please to come and hear. For life, I prize it\nAs I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,\n'Tis a derivative from me to mine,\nAnd only that I stand for. I appeal\nTo your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes\nCame to your court, how I was in your grace,\nHow merited to be so; since he came,\nWith what encounter so uncurrent I\nHave strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond\nThe bound of honour, or in act or will\nThat way inclining, harden'd be the hearts\nOf all that hear me, and my near'st of kin\nCry fie upon my grave!\nThat's true enough;\nThrough 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.\nMore than mistress of\nWhich comes to me in name of fault, I must not\nAt all acknowledge. For Polixenes,\nWith whom I am accused, I do confess\nI loved him as in honour he required,\nWith such a kind of love as might become\nA lady like me, with a love even such,\nSo and no other, as yourself commanded:\nWhich not to have done I think had been in me\nBoth disobedience and ingratitude\nTo you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,\nEven since it could speak, from an infant, freely\nThat it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,\nI know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd\nFor me to try how: all I know of it\nIs that Camillo was an honest man;\nAnd why he left your court, the gods themselves,\nWotting no more than I, are ignorant.\nSir,\nYou speak a language that I understand not:\nMy life stands in the level of your dreams,\nWhich I'll lay down.\nSir, spare your threats:\nThe bug which you would fright me with I seek.\nTo me can life be no commodity:\nThe crown and comfort of my life, your favour,\nI do give lost; for I do feel it gone,\nBut know not how it went. My second joy\nAnd first-fruits of my body, from his presence\nI am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort\nStarr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,\nThe innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,\nHaled out to murder: myself on every post\nProclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred\nThe child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs\nTo women of all fashion; lastly, hurried\nHere to this place, i' the open air, before\nI have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,\nTell me what blessings I have here alive,\nThat I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.\nBut yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,\nI prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,\nWhich I would free, if I shall be condemn'd\nUpon surmises, all proofs sleeping else\nBut what your jealousies awake, I tell you\n'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,\nI do refer me to the oracle:\nApollo be my judge!\nThe Emperor of Russia was my father:\nO that he were alive, and here beholding\nHis daughter's trial! that he did but see\nThe flatness of my misery, yet with eyes\nOf pity, not revenge!\nPraised!\nYou gods, look down\nAnd from your sacred vials pour your graces\nUpon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.\nWhere hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found\nThy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,\nKnowing by Paulina that the oracle\nGave hope thou wast in being, have preserved\nMyself to see the issue.\n", 'F'), ("If music be the food of love, play on;\nGive me excess of it, that, surfeiting,\nThe appetite may sicken, and so die.\nThat strain again! it had a dying fall:\nO, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,\nThat breathes upon a bank of violets,\nStealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:\n'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.\nO spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,\nThat, notwithstanding thy capacity\nReceiveth as the sea, nought enters there,\nOf what validity and pitch soe'er,\nBut falls into abatement and low price,\nEven in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy\nThat it alone is high fantastical.\nWhat, Curio?\nWhy, so I do, the noblest that I have:\nO, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,\nMethought she purged the air of pestilence!\nThat instant was I turn'd into a hart;\nAnd my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,\nE'er since pursue me.\nHow now! what news from her?\nO, she that hath a heart of that fine frame\nTo pay this debt of love but to a brother,\nHow will she love, when the rich golden shaft\nHath kill'd the flock of all affections else\nThat live in her; when liver, brain and heart,\nThese sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd\nHer sweet perfections with one self king!\nAway before me to sweet beds of flowers:\nLove-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.\nWho saw Cesario, ho?\nStand you a while aloof, Cesario,\nThou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd\nTo thee the book even of my secret soul:\nTherefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;\nBe not denied access, stand at her doors,\nAnd tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow\nTill thou have audience.\nBe clamorous and leap all civil bounds\nRather than make unprofited return.\nO, then unfold the passion of my love,\nSurprise her with discourse of my dear faith:\nIt shall become thee well to act my woes;\nShe will attend it better in thy youth\nThan in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.\nDear lad, believe it;\nFor they shall yet belie thy happy years,\nThat say thou art a man: Diana's lip\nIs not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe\nIs as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,\nAnd all is semblative a woman's part.\nI know thy constellation is right apt\nFor this affair. Some four or five attend him;\nAll, if you will; for I myself am best\nWhen least in company. Prosper well in this,\nAnd thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,\nTo call his fortunes thine.\nGive me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.\nNow, good Cesario, but that piece of song,\nThat old and antique song we heard last night:\nMethought it did relieve my passion much,\nMore than light airs and recollected terms\nOf these most brisk and giddy-paced times:\nCome, but one verse.\nWho was it?\nSeek him out, and play the tune the while.\nCome hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,\nIn the sweet pangs of it remember me;\nFor such as I am all true lovers are,\nUnstaid and skittish in all motions else,\nSave in the constant image of the creature\nThat is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?\nThou dost speak masterly:\nMy life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye\nHath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:\nHath it not, boy?\nWhat kind of woman is't?\nShe is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?\nToo old by heaven: let still the woman take\nAn elder than herself: so wears she to him,\nSo sways she level in her husband's heart:\nFor, boy, however we do praise ourselves,\nOur fancies are more giddy and unfirm,\nMore longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,\nThan women's are.\nThen let thy love be younger than thyself,\nOr thy affection cannot hold the bent;\nFor women are as roses, whose fair flower\nBeing once display'd, doth fall that very hour.\nO, fellow, come, the song we had last night.\nMark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;\nThe spinsters and the knitters in the sun\nAnd the free maids that weave their thread with bones\nDo use to chant it: it is silly sooth,\nAnd dallies with the innocence of love,\nLike the old age.\nAy; prithee, sing.\nThere's for thy pains.\nI'll pay thy pleasure then.\nGive me now leave to leave thee.\nLet all the rest give place.\nOnce more, Cesario,\nGet thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:\nTell her, my love, more noble than the world,\nPrizes not quantity of dirty lands;\nThe parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,\nTell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;\nBut 'tis that miracle and queen of gems\nThat nature pranks her in attracts my soul.\nI cannot be so answer'd.\nThere is no woman's sides\nCan bide the beating of so strong a passion\nAs love doth give my heart; no woman's heart\nSo big, to hold so much; they lack retention\nAlas, their love may be call'd appetite,\nNo motion of the liver, but the palate,\nThat suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;\nBut mine is all as hungry as the sea,\nAnd can digest as much: make no compare\nBetween that love a woman can bear me\nAnd that I owe Olivia.\nWhat dost thou know?\nAnd what's her history?\nBut died thy sister of her love, my boy?\nAy, that's the theme.\nTo her in haste; give her this jewel; say,\nMy love can give no place, bide no denay.\nBelong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?\nI know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?\nJust the contrary; the better for thy friends.\nHow can that be?\nWhy, this is excellent.\nThou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.\nO, you give me ill counsel.\nWell, I will be so much a sinner, to be a\ndouble-dealer: there's another.\nYou can fool no more money out of me at this throw:\nif you will let your lady know I am here to speak\nwith her, and bring her along with you, it may awake\nmy bounty further.\nThat face of his I do remember well;\nYet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd\nAs black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:\nA bawbling vessel was he captain of,\nFor shallow draught and bulk unprizable;\nWith which such scathful grapple did he make\nWith the most noble bottom of our fleet,\nThat very envy and the tongue of loss\nCried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?\nNotable pirate! thou salt-water thief!\nWhat foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,\nWhom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,\nHast made thine enemies?\nWhen came he to this town?\nHere comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.\nBut for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:\nThree months this youth hath tended upon me;\nBut more of that anon. Take him aside.\nGracious Olivia,\xe2\x80\x94\nStill so cruel?\nWhat, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,\nTo whose ingrate and unauspicious altars\nMy soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out\nThat e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?\nWhy should I not, had I the heart to do it,\nLike to the Egyptian thief at point of death,\nKill what I love?\xe2\x80\x94a savage jealousy\nThat sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:\nSince you to non-regardance cast my faith,\nAnd that I partly know the instrument\nThat screws me from my true place in your favour,\nLive you the marble-breasted tyrant still;\nBut this your minion, whom I know you love,\nAnd whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,\nHim will I tear out of that cruel eye,\nWhere he sits crowned in his master's spite.\nCome, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:\nI'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,\nTo spite a raven's heart within a dove.\nCome, away!\nHusband!\nHer husband, sirrah!\nO thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be\nWhen time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?\nOr will not else thy craft so quickly grow,\nThat thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?\nFarewell, and take her; but direct thy feet\nWhere thou and I henceforth may never meet.\nMy gentleman, Cesario?\nHow now, gentleman! how is't with you?\nOne face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,\nA natural perspective, that is and is not!\nBe not amazed; right noble is his blood.\nIf this be so, as yet the glass seems true,\nI shall have share in this most happy wreck.\nBoy, thou hast said to me a thousand times\nThou never shouldst love woman like to me.\nGive me thy hand;\nAnd let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.\nThis savours not much of distraction.\nMadam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.\nYour master quits you; and for your service done him,\nSo much against the mettle of your sex,\nSo far beneath your soft and tender breeding,\nAnd since you call'd me master for so long,\nHere is my hand: you shall from this time be\nYour master's mistress.\nIs this the madman?\nPursue him and entreat him to a peace:\nHe hath not told us of the captain yet:\nWhen that is known and golden time convents,\nA solemn combination shall be made\nOf our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,\nWe will not part from hence. Cesario, come;\nFor so you shall be, while you are a man;\nBut when in other habits you are seen,\nOrsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.\n", 'M'), ("Mates, maid! How mean you that? No mates for you,\nUnless you were of gentler, milder mould.\nFrom all such devils, good Lord deliver us!\nSignior Baptista, will you be so strange?\nSorry am I that our good will effects\nBianca's grief.\nSo Will I, Signior Gremio; but a word, I pray. Though\nthe nature of our quarrel yet never brook'd parle, know now, upon\nadvice, it toucheth us both- that we may yet again have access to\nour fair mistress, and be happy rivals in Bianca's love- to\nlabour and effect one thing specially.\nMarry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.\nI say a husband.\nTush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine to\nendure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the\nworld, an a man could light on them, would take her with all\nfaults, and money enough.\nFaith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten\napples. But, come; since this bar in law makes us friends, it\nshall be so far forth friendly maintain'd till by helping\nBaptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free\nfor a husband, and then have to't afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man\nbe his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you,\nSignior Gremio?\nHow now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio and my\ngood friend Petruchio!

I shall discover a\nthing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine\nown imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have\none eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,\nturn another into the register of your own; that I\nmay pass with a reproof the easier, sith you\nyourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.\nThere is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's\nname is Ford.\nI have long loved her, and, I protest to you,\nbestowed much on her; followed her with a doting\nobservance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;\nfee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly\ngive me sight of her; not only bought many presents\nto give her, but have given largely to many to know\nwhat she would have given; briefly, I have pursued\nher as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the\nwing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have\nmerited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,\nI am sure, I have received none; unless experience\nbe a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite\nrate, and that hath taught me to say this:\n'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;\nPursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'\nNever.\nNever.\nLike a fair house built on another man's ground; so\nthat I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place\nwhere I erected it.\nWhen I have told you that, I have told you all.\nSome say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in\nother places she enlargeth her mirth so far that\nthere is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir\nJohn, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a\ngentleman of excellent breeding, admirable\ndiscourse, of great admittance, authentic in your\nplace and person, generally allowed for your many\nwar-like, court-like, and learned preparations.\nBelieve it, for you know it. There is money; spend\nit, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only\ngive me so much of your time in exchange of it, as\nto lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this\nFord's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to\nconsent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as\nany.\nO, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on\nthe excellency of her honour, that the folly of my\nsoul dares not present itself: she is too bright to\nbe looked against. Now, could I could come to her\nwith any detection in my hand, my desires had\ninstance and argument to commend themselves: I\ncould drive her then from the ward of her purity,\nher reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand\nother her defences, which now are too too strongly\nembattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?\nO good sir!\nWant no money, Sir John; you shall want none.\nI am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,\nsir?\nI would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him\nif you saw him.\nWhat a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is\nready to crack with impatience. Who says this is\nimprovident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the\nhour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man\nhave thought this? See the hell of having a false\nwoman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers\nransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not\nonly receive this villanous wrong, but stand under\nthe adoption of abominable terms, and by him that\ndoes me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds\nwell; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are\ndevils' additions, the names of fiends: but\nCuckold! Wittol!\xe2\x80\x94Cuckold! the devil himself hath\nnot such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he\nwill trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will\nrather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh\nthe Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my\naqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling\ngelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,\nthen she ruminates, then she devises; and what they\nthink in their hearts they may effect, they will\nbreak their hearts but they will effect. God be\npraised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.\nI will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on\nFalstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;\nbetter three hours too soon than a minute too late.\nFie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!\nWell met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?\nAy; and as idle as she may hang together, for want\nof company. I think, if your husbands were dead,\nyou two would marry.\nWhere had you this pretty weather-cock?\nSir John Falstaff!\nIndeed she is.\nHas Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath he any\nthinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.\nWhy, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as\neasy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve\nscore. He pieces out his wife's inclination; he\ngives her folly motion and advantage: and now she's\ngoing to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A\nman may hear this shower sing in the wind. And\nFalstaff's boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;\nand our revolted wives share damnation together.\nWell; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck\nthe borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming\nMistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and\nwilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all\nmy neighbours shall cry aim.\nThe clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me\nsearch: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be\nrather praised for this than mocked; for it is as\npositive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is\nthere: I will go.\nTrust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at home;\nand I pray you all go with me.\nI beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me\nto dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have\nsport; I will show you a monster. Master doctor,\nyou shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.\nI think I shall drink in pipe wine first\nwith him; I'll make him dance. Will you go, gentles?\nPray you, come near: if I suspect without cause,\nwhy then make sport at me; then let me be your jest;\nI deserve it. How now! whither bear you this?\nBuck! I would I could wash myself of the buck!\nBuck, buck, buck! Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck;\nand of the season too, it shall appear.\nGentlemen, I have dreamed to-night; I'll tell you my\ndream. Here, here, here be my keys: ascend my\nchambers; search, seek, find out: I'll warrant\nwe'll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first.\nSo, now uncape.\nTrue, Master Page. Up, gentlemen: you shall see\nsport anon: follow me, gentlemen.\nI cannot find him: may be the knave bragged of that\nhe could not compass.\nAy, I do so.\nAmen!\nAy, ay; I must bear it.\n'Tis my fault, Master Page: I suffer for it.\nWell, I promised you a dinner. Come, come, walk in\nthe Park: I pray you, pardon me; I will hereafter\nmake known to you why I have done this. Come,\nwife; come, Mistress Page. I pray you, pardon me;\npray heartily, pardon me.\nAny thing.\nPray you, go, Master Page.\nBless you, sir!\nThat, indeed, Sir John, is my business.\nAnd sped you, sir?\nHow so, sir? Did she change her determination?\nWhat, while you were there?\nAnd did he search for you, and could not find you?\nA buck-basket!\nAnd how long lay you there?\nIn good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you\nhave sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;\nyou'll undertake her no more?\n'Tis past eight already, sir.\nHum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I\nsleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!\nthere's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.\nThis 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen\nand buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself\nwhat I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my\nhouse; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he\nshould; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,\nnor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that\nguides him should aid him, I will search\nimpossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,\nyet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:\nif I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go\nwith me: I'll be horn-mad.\nWhich way should be go? how should I bestow him?\nShall I put him into the basket again?\nAy, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any\nway then to unfool me again? Set down the basket,\nvillain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!\nO you panderly rascals! there's a knot, a ging, a\npack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil\nbe shamed. What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!\nBehold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!\nSo say I too, sir.\nCome hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford the honest\nwoman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that\nhath the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect\nwithout cause, mistress, do I?\nWell said, brazen-face! hold it out. Come forth, sirrah!\nI shall find you anon.\nEmpty the basket, I say!\nMaster Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed\nout of my house yesterday in this basket: why may\nnot he be there again? In my house I am sure he is:\nmy intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.\nPluck me out all the linen.\nWell, he's not here I seek for.\nHelp to search my house this one time. If I find\nnot what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let\nme for ever be your table-sport; let them say of\nme, 'As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow\nwalnut for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more;\nonce more search with me.\nOld woman! what old woman's that?\nA witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not\nforbid her my house? She comes of errands, does\nshe? We are simple men; we do not know what's\nbrought to pass under the profession of\nfortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells,\nby the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond\nour element we know nothing. Come down, you witch,\nyou hag, you; come down, I say!\nI'll prat her.\nOut of my door, you witch, you hag, you baggage, you\npolecat, you runyon! out, out! I'll conjure you,\nI'll fortune-tell you.\nHang her, witch!\nWill you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you, follow;\nsee but the issue of my jealousy: if I cry out thus\nupon no trail, never trust me when I open again.\nPardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;\nI rather will suspect the sun with cold\nThan thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand\nIn him that was of late an heretic,\nAs firm as faith.\nThere is no better way than that they spoke of.\nThe children must\nBe practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.\nThat will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.\nNay I'll to him again in name of Brook\nHe'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.\nWent you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me\nyou had appointed?\nNow, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,\nFalstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his\nhorns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath\nenjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his\ncudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be\npaid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for\nit, Master Brook.\nAy, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.\nWell said, fairy Hugh.\nI will never mistrust my wife again till thou art\nable to woo her in good English.\nWhat, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?\nAnd one that is as slanderous as Satan?\nAnd as wicked as his wife?\nMarry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one\nMaster Brook, that you have cozened of money, to\nwhom you should have been a pander: over and above\nthat you have suffered, I think to repay that money\nwill be a biting affliction.\nThis is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?\nStand not amazed; here is no remedy:\nIn love the heavens themselves do guide the state;\nMoney buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.\nLet it be so.

I shall speak as much as thou\nafterwards.\nI will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall I?\nI will see you hanged, like clotpoles, ere I come\nany more to your tents: I will keep where there is\nwit stirring and leave the faction of fools.\nHow now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of\nthy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He\nbeats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!\nwould it were otherwise; that I could beat him,\nwhilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to\nconjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of\nmy spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a\nrare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two\nundermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of\nthemselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,\nforget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,\nMercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy\ncaduceus, if ye take not that little, little less\nthan little wit from them that they have! which\nshort-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant\nscarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly\nfrom a spider, without drawing their massy irons and\ncutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the\nwhole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,\nmethinks, is the curse dependent on those that war\nfor a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy\nsay Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!\nIf I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou\nwouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but\nit is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common\ncurse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in\ngreat revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and\ndiscipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy\ndirection till thy death! then if she that lays thee\nout says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and\nsworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.\nAmen. Where's Achilles?\nAy: the heavens hear me!\nThy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,\nwhat's Achilles?\nThy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,\nwhat art thou?\nI'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands\nAchilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus'\nknower, and Patroclus is a fool.\nPeace, fool! I have not done.\nAgamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites\nis a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.\nAgamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;\nAchilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;\nThersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and\nPatroclus is a fool positive.\nMake that demand of the prover. It suffices me thou\nart. Look you, who comes here?\nHere is such patchery, such juggling and such\nknavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a\nwhore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions\nand bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo on\nthe subject! and war and lechery confound all!\nA wonder!\nAjax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.\nHe must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so\nprophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he\nraves in saying nothing.\nWhy, he stalks up and down like a peacock,\xe2\x80\x94a stride\nand a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no\narithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:\nbites his lip with a politic regard, as who should\nsay 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'\nand so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire\nin a flint, which will not show without knocking.\nThe man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his\nneck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in\nvain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,\nAjax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think\nyou of this man that takes me for the general? He's\ngrown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.\nA plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both\nsides, like a leather jerkin.\nWho, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not\nanswering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his\ntongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let\nPatroclus make demands to me, you shall see the\npageant of Ajax.\nHum!\nHa!\nHum!\nAgamemnon!\nHa!\nGod b' wi' you, with all my heart.\nIf to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it will\ngo one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for me\nere he has me.\nFare you well, with all my heart.\nNo, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in\nhim when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know\nnot; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo\nget his sinews to make catlings on.\nLet me bear another to his horse; for that's the more\ncapable creature.\nWould the fountain of your mind were clear again,\nthat I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a\ntick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.\nWhy, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idol\nof idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee.\nWhy, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.\nThe surgeon's box, or the patient's wound.\nPrithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy talk:\nthou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.\nWhy, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases\nof the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs,\nloads o' gravel i' the back, lethargies, cold\npalsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing\nlungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas,\nlimekilns i' the palm, incurable bone-ache, and the\nrivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take\nagain such preposterous discoveries!\nDo I curse thee?\nNo! why art thou then exasperate, thou idle\nimmaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarcenet\nflap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's\npurse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered\nwith such waterflies, diminutives of nature!\nFinch-egg!\nWith too much blood and too little brain, these two\nmay run mad; but, if with too much brain and too\nlittle blood they do, I'll be a curer of madmen.\nHere's Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough and one\nthat loves quails; but he has not so much brain as\nearwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiter\nthere, his brother, the bull,\xe2\x80\x94the primitive statue,\nand oblique memorial of cuckolds; a thrifty\nshoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother's\nleg,\xe2\x80\x94to what form but that he is, should wit larded\nwith malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?\nTo an ass, were nothing; he is both ass and ox: to\nan ox, were nothing; he is both ox and ass. To be a\ndog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an\nowl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would\nnot care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire\nagainst destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if I\nwere not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse\nof a lazar, so I were not Menelaus! Hey-day!\nspirits and fires!\nSweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink,\nsweet sewer.\nThat same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a most\nunjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers\nthan I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend\nhis mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound:\nbut when he performs, astronomers foretell it; it\nis prodigious, there will come some change; the sun\nborrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his\nword. I will rather leave to see Hector, than\nnot to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan\ndrab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll\nafter. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!\nAnd any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff;\nshe's noted.\nRoguery!\nA juggling trick,\xe2\x80\x94to be secretly open.\nHow the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and\npotato-finger, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry!\nNow the pledge; now, now, now!\nNow she sharpens: well said, whetstone!\nNor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases me best.\nA proof of strength she could not publish more,\nUnless she said ' My mind is now turn'd whore.'\nWill he swagger himself out on's own eyes?\nHe'll tickle it for his concupy.\nWould I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would\ncroak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode.\nPatroclus will give me any thing for the\nintelligence of this whore: the parrot will not\ndo more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.\nLechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery; nothing\nelse holds fashion: a burning devil take them!\nNow they are clapper-clawing one another; I'll go\nlook on. That dissembling abominable varlets Diomed,\nhas got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's\nsleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain see\nthem meet; that that same young Trojan ass, that\nloves the whore there, might send that Greekish\nwhore-masterly villain, with the sleeve, back to the\ndissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless errand.\nO' the t'other side, the policy of those crafty\nswearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry\ncheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is\nnot proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up, in\npolicy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog of\nas bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax\nprouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm\nto-day; whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim\nbarbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion.\nSoft! here comes sleeve, and t'other.\nHold thy whore, Grecian!\xe2\x80\x94now for thy whore,\nTrojan!\xe2\x80\x94now the sleeve, now the sleeve!\nNo, no, I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave:\na very filthy rogue.\nGod-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me; but a\nplague break thy neck for frightening me! What's\nbecome of the wenching rogues? I think they have\nswallowed one another: I would laugh at that\nmiracle: yet, in a sort, lechery eats itself.\nI'll seek them.\nThe cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it. Now,\nbull! now, dog!

I have heard you say,\nHonour and policy, like unsever'd friends,\nI' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,\nIn peace what each of them by the other lose,\nThat they combine not there.\nIf it be honour in your wars to seem\nThe same you are not, which, for your best ends,\nYou adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,\nThat it shall hold companionship in peace\nWith honour, as in war, since that to both\nIt stands in like request?\nBecause that now it lies you on to speak\nTo the people; not by your own instruction,\nNor by the matter which your heart prompts you,\nBut with such words that are but rooted in\nYour tongue, though but bastards and syllables\nOf no allowance to your bosom's truth.\nNow, this no more dishonours you at all\nThan to take in a town with gentle words,\nWhich else would put you to your fortune and\nThe hazard of much blood.\nI would dissemble with my nature where\nMy fortunes and my friends at stake required\nI should do so in honour: I am in this,\nYour wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;\nAnd you will rather show our general louts\nHow you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,\nFor the inheritance of their loves and safeguard\nOf what that want might ruin.\nI prithee now, my son,\nGo to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;\nAnd thus far having stretch'd it\xe2\x80\x94here be with them\xe2\x80\x94\nThy knee bussing the stones\xe2\x80\x94for in such business\nAction is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant\nMore learned than the ears\xe2\x80\x94waving thy head,\nWhich often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,\nNow humble as the ripest mulberry\nThat will not hold the handling: or say to them,\nThou art their soldier, and being bred in broils\nHast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,\nWere fit for thee to use as they to claim,\nIn asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame\nThyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far\nAs thou hast power and person.\nPrithee now,\nGo, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather\nFollow thine enemy in a fiery gulf\nThan flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.\nHe must, and will\nPrithee now, say you will, and go about it.\nI prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said\nMy praises made thee first a soldier, so,\nTo have my praise for this, perform a part\nThou hast not done before.\nAt thy choice, then:\nTo beg of thee, it is my more dishonour\nThan thou of them. Come all to ruin; let\nThy mother rather feel thy pride than fear\nThy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death\nWith as big heart as thou. Do as thou list\nThy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,\nBut owe thy pride thyself.\nDo your will.\nNow the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,\nAnd occupations perish!\nMy first son.\nWhither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius\nWith thee awhile: determine on some course,\nMore than a wild exposture to each chance\nThat starts i' the way before thee.\nO, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods\nRequite your love!\nIf that I could for weeping, you should hear,\xe2\x80\x94\nNay, and you shall hear some.\nWill you be gone?\nAy, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.\nWas not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship\nTo banish him that struck more blows for Rome\nThan thou hast spoken words?\nMore noble blows than ever thou wise words;\nAnd for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:\nNay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son\nWere in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,\nHis good sword in his hand.\nBastards and all.\nGood man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!\n'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:\nCats, that can judge as fitly of his worth\nAs I can of those mysteries which heaven\nWill not have earth to know.\nNow, pray, sir, get you gone:\nYou have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:\xe2\x80\x94\nAs far as doth the Capitol exceed\nThe meanest house in Rome, so far my son\xe2\x80\x94\nThis lady's husband here, this, do you see\xe2\x80\x94\nWhom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.\nTake my prayers with you.\nI would the gods had nothing else to do\nBut to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em\nBut once a-day, it would unclog my heart\nOf what lies heavy to't.\nAnger's my meat; I sup upon myself,\nAnd so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:\nLeave this faint puling and lament as I do,\nIn anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.\nO, stand up blest!\nWhilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,\nI kneel before thee; and unproperly\nShow duty, as mistaken all this while\nBetween the child and parent.\nThou art my warrior;\nI holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?\nThis is a poor epitome of yours,\nWhich by the interpretation of full time\nMay show like all yourself.\nYour knee, sirrah.\nEven he, your wife, this lady, and myself,\nAre suitors to you.\nO, no more, no more!\nYou have said you will not grant us any thing;\nFor we have nothing else to ask, but that\nWhich you deny already: yet we will ask;\nThat, if you fail in our request, the blame\nMay hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.\nShould we be silent and not speak, our raiment\nAnd state of bodies would bewray what life\nWe have led since thy exile. Think with thyself\nHow more unfortunate than all living women\nAre we come hither: since that thy sight,\nwhich should\nMake our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance\nwith comforts,\nConstrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;\nMaking the mother, wife and child to see\nThe son, the husband and the father tearing\nHis country's bowels out. And to poor we\nThine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us\nOur prayers to the gods, which is a comfort\nThat all but we enjoy; for how can we,\nAlas, how can we for our country pray.\nWhereto we are bound, together with thy victory,\nWhereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose\nThe country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,\nOur comfort in the country. We must find\nAn evident calamity, though we had\nOur wish, which side should win: for either thou\nMust, as a foreign recreant, be led\nWith manacles thorough our streets, or else\ntriumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,\nAnd bear the palm for having bravely shed\nThy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,\nI purpose not to wait on fortune till\nThese wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee\nRather to show a noble grace to both parts\nThan seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner\nMarch to assault thy country than to tread\xe2\x80\x94\nTrust to't, thou shalt not\xe2\x80\x94on thy mother's womb,\nThat brought thee to this world.\nNay, go not from us thus.\nIf it were so that our request did tend\nTo save the Romans, thereby to destroy\nThe Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,\nAs poisonous of your honour: no; our suit\nIs that you reconcile them: while the Volsces\nMay say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,\n'This we received;' and each in either side\nGive the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest\nFor making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,\nThe end of war's uncertain, but this certain,\nThat, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit\nWhich thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,\nWhose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;\nWhose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,\nBut with his last attempt he wiped it out;\nDestroy'd his country, and his name remains\nTo the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:\nThou hast affected the fine strains of honour,\nTo imitate the graces of the gods;\nTo tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,\nAnd yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt\nThat should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?\nThink'st thou it honourable for a noble man\nStill to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:\nHe cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:\nPerhaps thy childishness will move him more\nThan can our reasons. There's no man in the world\nMore bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate\nLike one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life\nShow'd thy dear mother any courtesy,\nWhen she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,\nHas cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,\nLoaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,\nAnd spurn me back: but if it be not so,\nThou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,\nThat thou restrain'st from me the duty which\nTo a mother's part belongs. He turns away:\nDown, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.\nTo his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride\nThan pity to our prayers. Down: an end;\nThis is the last: so we will home to Rome,\nAnd die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:\nThis boy, that cannot tell what he would have\nBut kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,\nDoes reason our petition with more strength\nThan thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:\nThis fellow had a Volscian to his mother;\nHis wife is in Corioli and his child\nLike him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:\nI am hush'd until our city be a-fire,\nAnd then I'll speak a little.\n", 'F'), ("You have little cause to say so.\nYou shall not write my praise.\nHow if fair and foolish?\nGood morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry\nFor your displeasure; but all will sure be well.\nThe general and his wife are talking of it;\nAnd she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,\nThat he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,\nAnd great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom\nHe might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you\nAnd needs no other suitor but his likings\nTo take the safest occasion by the front\nTo bring you in again.\nPray you, come in;\nI will bestow you where you shall have time\nTo speak your bosom freely.\nGood madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,\nAs if the case were his.\nMadam, here comes my lord.\nI am glad I have found this napkin:\nThis was her first remembrance from the Moor:\nMy wayward husband hath a hundred times\nWoo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,\nFor he conjured her she should ever keep it,\nThat she reserves it evermore about her\nTo kiss and talk to.

I pray you, ask him some\nquestions in his accidence.\nCome on, sirrah; hold up your head; answer your\nmaster, be not afraid.\nPeace!\nPrithee, hold thy peace.\nHe is a better scholar than I thought he was.\nAdieu, good Sir Hugh.\nGet you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.\nWhat, ho, gossip Ford! what, ho!\nHow now, sweetheart! who's at home besides yourself?\nIndeed!\nTruly, I am so glad you have nobody here.\nWhy, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again:\nhe so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails\nagainst all married mankind; so curses all Eve's\ndaughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets\nhimself on the forehead, crying, 'Peer out, peer\nout!' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but\ntameness, civility and patience, to this his\ndistemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.\nOf none but him; and swears he was carried out, the\nlast time he searched for him, in a basket; protests\nto my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and\nthe rest of their company from their sport, to make\nanother experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad\nthe knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.\nHard by; at street end; he will be here anon.\nWhy then you are utterly shamed, and he's but a dead\nman. What a woman are you!\xe2\x80\x94Away with him, away\nwith him! better shame than murder.\nAlas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door\nwith pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise\nyou might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?\nIf you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir\nJohn. Unless you go out disguised\xe2\x80\x94\nAlas the day, I know not! There is no woman's gown\nbig enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat,\na muffler and a kerchief, and so escape.\nOn my word, it will serve him; she's as big as he\nis: and there's her thrummed hat and her muffler\ntoo. Run up, Sir John.\nQuick, quick! we'll come dress you straight: put\non the gown the while.\nHeaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel, and the\ndevil guide his cudgel afterwards!\nAh, in good sadness, is he; and talks of the basket\ntoo, howsoever he hath had intelligence.\nNay, but he'll be here presently: let's go dress him\nlike the witch of Brentford.\nHang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse him enough.\nWe'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,\nWives may be merry, and yet honest too:\nWe do not act that often jest and laugh;\n'Tis old, but true, Still swine eat all the draff.\nCome, Mother Prat; come, give me your hand.\nAre you not ashamed? I think you have killed the\npoor woman.\nTrust me, he beat him most pitifully.\nI'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o'er the\naltar; it hath done meritorious service.\nThe spirit of wantonness is, sure, scared out of\nhim: if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with\nfine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the\nway of waste, attempt us again.\nYes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the\nfigures out of your husband's brains. If they can\nfind in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight\nshall be any further afflicted, we two will still be\nthe ministers.\nCome, to the forge with it then; shape it: I would\nnot have things cool.\nWithin a quarter of an hour.\nThere is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,\nSometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,\nDoth all the winter-time, at still midnight,\nWalk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;\nAnd there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle\nAnd makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain\nIn a most hideous and dreadful manner:\nYou have heard of such a spirit, and well you know\nThe superstitious idle-headed eld\nReceived and did deliver to our age\nThis tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.\nThat likewise have we thought upon, and thus:\nNan Page my daughter and my little son\nAnd three or four more of their growth we'll dress\nLike urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,\nWith rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,\nAnd rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,\nAs Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,\nLet them from forth a sawpit rush at once\nWith some diffused song: upon their sight,\nWe two in great amazedness will fly:\nThen let them all encircle him about\nAnd, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,\nAnd ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,\nIn their so sacred paths he dares to tread\nIn shape profane.\nThe truth being known,\nWe'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,\nAnd mock him home to Windsor.\nMy Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,\nFinely attired in a robe of white.\nFear not you that. Go get us properties\nAnd tricking for our fairies.\nGo, Mistress Ford,\nSend quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.\nI'll to the doctor: he hath my good will,\nAnd none but he, to marry with Nan Page.\nThat Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;\nAnd he my husband best of all affects.\nThe doctor is well money'd, and his friends\nPotent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,\nThough twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.\nMaster doctor, my daughter is in green: when you\nsee your time, take her by the band, away with her\nto the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before\ninto the Park: we two must go together.\nFare you well, sir.\nMy husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of\nFalstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying\nmy daughter: but 'tis no matter; better a little\nchiding than a great deal of heart-break.\nThey are all couched in a pit hard by Herne's oak,\nwith obscured lights; which, at the very instant of\nFalstaff's and our meeting, they will at once\ndisplay to the night.\nIf he be not amazed, he will be mocked; if he be\namazed, he will every way be mocked.\nAgainst such lewdsters and their lechery\nThose that betray them do no treachery.\nAlas, what noise?\nI pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher\nNow, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?\nSee you these, husband? do not these fair yokes\nBecome the forest better than the town?\nWhy Sir John, do you think, though we would have the\nvirtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders\nand have given ourselves without scruple to hell,\nthat ever the devil could have made you our delight?\nA puffed man?\nDoctors doubt that: if Anne Page be my\ndaughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.\nGood George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose;\nturned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is\nnow with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.\nWhy, did you take her in green?\nWhy went you not with master doctor, maid?\nWell, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,\nHeaven give you many, many merry days!\nGood husband, let us every one go home,\nAnd laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;\nSir John and all.\n", 'F'), ("The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe\nas the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in\nthe ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;\nand anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,\nthe soil, the land, the earth.\nSir Nathaniel, haud credo.\nMost barbarous intimation! yet a kind of\ninsinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of\nexplication; facere, as it were, replication, or\nrather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his\ninclination, after his undressed, unpolished,\nuneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,\nunlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to\ninsert again my haud credo for a deer.\nTwice-sod simplicity, his coctus!\nO thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!\nDictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.\nThe moon was a month old when Adam was no more,\nAnd raught not to five weeks when he came to\nfive-score.\nThe allusion holds in the exchange.\nGod comfort thy capacity!

Therefore, go back.\nYou are a Roman, are you?\nThen you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,\nwhen you have pushed out your gates the very\ndefender of them, and, in a violent popular\nignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to\nfront his revenges with the easy groans of old\nwomen, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with\nthe palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as\nyou seem to be? Can you think to blow out the\nintended fire your city is ready to flame in, with\nsuch weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;\ntherefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your\nexecution: you are condemned, our general has sworn\nyou out of reprieve and pardon.\nMy general cares not for you.
