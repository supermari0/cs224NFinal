The state, whereon I studied\nIs like a good thing, being often read,\nGrown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,\nWherein\xe2\x80\x94let no man hear me\xe2\x80\x94I take pride,\nCould I with boot change for an idle plume,\nWhich the air beats for vain. O place, O form,\nHow often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,\nWrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls\nTo thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:\nLet's write good angel on the devil's horn:\n'Tis not the devil's crest.\nHow now! who's there?\nTeach her the way.\nO heavens!\nWhy does my blood thus muster to my heart,\nMaking both it unable for itself,\nAnd dispossessing all my other parts\nOf necessary fitness?\nSo play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;\nCome all to help him, and so stop the air\nBy which he should revive: and even so\nThe general, subject to a well-wish'd king,\nQuit their own part, and in obsequious fondness\nCrowd to his presence, where their untaught love\nMust needs appear offence.\nHow now, fair maid?\nThat you might know it, would much better please me\nThan to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.\nYet may he live awhile; and, it may be,\nAs long as you or I. yet he must die.\nYea.\nHa! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good\nTo pardon him that hath from nature stolen\nA man already made, as to remit\nTheir saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image\nIn stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy\nFalsely to take away a life true made\nAs to put metal in restrained means\nTo make a false one.\nSay you so? then I shall pose you quickly.\nWhich had you rather, that the most just law\nNow took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,\nGive up your body to such sweet uncleanness\nAs she that he hath stain'd?\nI talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins\nStand more for number than for accompt.\nNay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak\nAgainst the thing I say. Answer to this:\nI, now the voice of the recorded law,\nPronounce a sentence on your brother's life:\nMight there not be a charity in sin\nTo save this brother's life?\nPleased you to do't at peril of your soul,\nWere equal poise of sin and charity.\nNay, but hear me.\nYour sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,\nOr seem so craftily; and that's not good.\nThus wisdom wishes to appear most bright\nWhen it doth tax itself; as these black masks\nProclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder\nThan beauty could, display'd. But mark me;\nTo be received plain, I'll speak more gross:\nYour brother is to die.\nAnd his offence is so, as it appears,\nAccountant to the law upon that pain.\nAdmit no other way to save his life,\xe2\x80\x94\nAs I subscribe not that, nor any other,\nBut in the loss of question,\xe2\x80\x94that you, his sister,\nFinding yourself desired of such a person,\nWhose credit with the judge, or own great place,\nCould fetch your brother from the manacles\nOf the all-building law; and that there were\nNo earthly mean to save him, but that either\nYou must lay down the treasures of your body\nTo this supposed, or else to let him suffer;\nWhat would you do?\nThen must your brother die.\nWere not you then as cruel as the sentence\nThat you have slander'd so?\nYou seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;\nAnd rather proved the sliding of your brother\nA merriment than a vice.\nWe are all frail.\nNay, women are frail too.\nI think it well:\nAnd from this testimony of your own sex,\xe2\x80\x94\nSince I suppose we are made to be no stronger\nThan faults may shake our frames,\xe2\x80\x94let me be bold;\nI do arrest your words. Be that you are,\nThat is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;\nIf you be one, as you are well express'd\nBy all external warrants, show it now,\nBy putting on the destined livery.\nPlainly conceive, I love you.\nHe shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.\nBelieve me, on mine honour,\nMy words express my purpose.\nWho will believe thee, Isabel?\nMy unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,\nMy vouch against you, and my place i' the state,\nWill so your accusation overweigh,\nThat you shall stifle in your own report\nAnd smell of calumny. I have begun,\nAnd now I give my sensual race the rein:\nFit thy consent to my sharp appetite;\nLay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,\nThat banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother\nBy yielding up thy body to my will;\nOr else he must not only die the death,\nBut thy unkindness shall his death draw out\nTo lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,\nOr, by the affection that now guides me most,\nI'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,\nSay what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.\nIn most uneven and distracted manner. His actions\nshow much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be\nnot tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and\nredeliver our authorities there\nAnd why should we proclaim it in an hour before his\nentering, that if any crave redress of injustice,\nthey should exhibit their petitions in the street?\nWell, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes\ni' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give\nnotice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet\nhim.\nGood night.\nThis deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant\nAnd dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!\nAnd by an eminent body that enforced\nThe law against it! But that her tender shame\nWill not proclaim against her maiden loss,\nHow might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;\nFor my authority bears of a credent bulk,\nThat no particular scandal once can touch\nBut it confounds the breather. He should have lived,\nSave that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,\nMight in the times to come have ta'en revenge,\nBy so receiving a dishonour'd life\nWith ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!\nA lack, when once our grace we have forgot,\nNothing goes right: we would, and we would not.\nHappy return be to your royal grace!\nYou make my bonds still greater.\nMy lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:\nShe hath been a suitor to me for her brother\nCut off by course of justice,\xe2\x80\x94\nAnd she will speak most bitterly and strange.\nCharges she more than me?\nThis is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.\nMy lord, I must confess I know this woman:\nAnd five years since there was some speech of marriage\nBetwixt myself and her; which was broke off,\nPartly for that her promised proportions\nCame short of composition, but in chief\nFor that her reputation was disvalued\nIn levity: since which time of five years\nI never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,\nUpon my faith and honour.\nI did but smile till now:\nNow, good my lord, give me the scope of justice\nMy patience here is touch'd. I do perceive\nThese poor informal women are no more\nBut instruments of some more mightier member\nThat sets them on: let me have way, my lord,\nTo find this practise out.\nWhat can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?\nIs this the man that you did tell us of?\nHark, how the villain would close now, after his\ntreasonable abuses!\nWhat, resists he? Help him, Lucio.\nO my dread lord,\nI should be guiltier than my guiltiness,\nTo think I can be undiscernible,\nWhen I perceive your grace, like power divine,. Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,\nNo longer session hold upon my shame,\nBut let my trial be mine own confession:\nImmediate sentence then and sequent death\nIs all the grace I beg.\nI was, my lord.\nI am sorry that such sorrow I procure:\nAnd so deep sticks it in my penitent heart\nThat I crave death more willingly than mercy;\n'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.\n", 'M'), ("Suffolk, arise.

That seal,\nYou ask with such a violence, the king,\nMine and your master, with his own hand gave me;\nBade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,\nDuring my life; and, to confirm his goodness,\nTied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?\nIt must be himself, then.\nProud lord, thou liest:\nWithin these forty hours Surrey durst better\nHave burnt that tongue than said so.\nThis, and all else\nThis talking lord can lay upon my credit,\nI answer is most false. The duke by law\nFound his deserts: how innocent I was\nFrom any private malice in his end,\nHis noble jury and foul cause can witness.\nIf I loved many words, lord, I should tell you\nYou have as little honesty as honour,\nThat in the way of loyalty and truth\nToward the king, my ever royal master,\nDare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,\nAnd all that love his follies.\nAll goodness\nIs poison to thy stomach.\nHow much, methinks, I could despise this man,\nBut that I am bound in charity against it!\nSo much fairer\nAnd spotless shall mine innocence arise,\nWhen the king knows my truth.\nSpeak on, sir;\nI dare your worst objections: if I blush,\nIt is to see a nobleman want manners.\nSo farewell to the little good you bear me.\nFarewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!\nThis is the state of man: to-day he puts forth\nThe tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,\nAnd bears his blushing honours thick upon him;\nThe third day comes a frost, a killing frost,\nAnd, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely\nHis greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,\nAnd then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,\nLike little wanton boys that swim on bladders,\nThis many summers in a sea of glory,\nBut far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride\nAt length broke under me and now has left me,\nWeary and old with service, to the mercy\nOf a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.\nVain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:\nI feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched\nIs that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!\nThere is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,\nThat sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,\nMore pangs and fears than wars or women have:\nAnd when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,\nNever to hope again.\nWhy, how now, Cromwell!\nWhat, amazed\nAt my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder\nA great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,\nI am fall'n indeed.\nWhy, well;\nNever so truly happy, my good Cromwell.\nI know myself now; and I feel within me\nA peace above all earthly dignities,\nA still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,\nI humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,\nThese ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken\nA load would sink a navy, too much honour:\nO, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthen\nToo heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!\nI hope I have: I am able now, methinks,\nOut of a fortitude of soul I feel,\nTo endure more miseries and greater far\nThan my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.\nWhat news abroad?\nGod bless him!\nThat's somewhat sudden:\nBut he's a learned man. May he continue\nLong in his highness' favour, and do justice\nFor truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,\nWhen he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,\nMay have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em! What more?\nThat's news indeed.\nThere was the weight that pull'd me down.

Be just, and fear not:\nLet all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,\nThy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st,\nO Cromwell,\nThou fall'st a blessed martyr!

Hear'st thou, Pisanio?\nHe is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me\nHow far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs\nMay plod it in a week, why may not I\nGlide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,\xe2\x80\x94\nWho long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,\xe2\x80\x94\nlet me bate,-but not like me\xe2\x80\x94yet long'st,\nBut in a fainter kind:\xe2\x80\x94O, not like me;\nFor mine's beyond beyond\xe2\x80\x94say, and speak thick;\nLove's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,\nTo the smothering of the sense\xe2\x80\x94how far it is\nTo this same blessed Milford: and by the way\nTell me how Wales was made so happy as\nTo inherit such a haven: but first of all,\nHow we may steal from hence, and for the gap\nThat we shall make in time, from our hence-going\nAnd our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:\nWhy should excuse be born or e'er begot?\nWe'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,\nHow many score of miles may we well ride\n'Twixt hour and hour?\nWhy, one that rode to's execution, man,\nCould never go so slow: I have heard of\nriding wagers,\nWhere horses have been nimbler than the sands\nThat run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:\nGo bid my woman feign a sickness; say\nShe'll home to her father: and provide me presently\nA riding-suit, no costlier than would fit\nA franklin's housewife.\nI see before me, man: nor here, nor here,\nNor what ensues, but have a fog in them,\nThat I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;\nDo as I bid thee: there's no more to say,\nAccessible is none but Milford way.\nThou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place\nWas near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so\nTo see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!\nWhere is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,\nThat makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh\nFrom the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,\nWould be interpreted a thing perplex'd\nBeyond self-explication: put thyself\nInto a havior of less fear, ere wildness\nVanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?\nWhy tender'st thou that paper to me, with\nA look untender? If't be summer news,\nSmile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st\nBut keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!\nThat drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,\nAnd he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue\nMay take off some extremity, which to read\nWould be even mortal to me.\n'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the\nstrumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie\nbleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,\nbut from proof as strong as my grief and as certain\nas I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,\nmust act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with\nthe breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away\nher life: I shall give thee opportunity at\nMilford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose\nwhere, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain\nit is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and\nequally to me disloyal.'\nFalse to his bed! What is it to be false?\nTo lie in watch there and to think on him?\nTo weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep\ncharge nature,\nTo break it with a fearful dream of him\nAnd cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?\nI false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,\nThou didst accuse him of incontinency;\nThou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks\nThy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy\nWhose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:\nPoor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;\nAnd, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,\nI must be ripp'd:\xe2\x80\x94to pieces with me!\xe2\x80\x94O,\nMen's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,\nBy thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought\nPut on for villany; not born where't grows,\nBut worn a bait for ladies.\nTrue honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,\nWere in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping\nDid scandal many a holy tear, took pity\nFrom most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,\nWilt lay the leaven on all proper men;\nGoodly and gallant shall be false and perjured\nFrom thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:\nDo thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,\nA little witness my obedience: look!\nI draw the sword myself: take it, and hit\nThe innocent mansion of my love, my heart;\nFear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;\nThy master is not there, who was indeed\nThe riches of it: do his bidding; strike\nThou mayst be valiant in a better cause;\nBut now thou seem'st a coward.\nWhy, I must die;\nAnd if I do not by thy hand, thou art\nNo servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter\nThere is a prohibition so divine\nThat cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.\nSomething's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;\nObedient as the scabbard. What is here?\nThe scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,\nAll turn'd to heresy? Away, away,\nCorrupters of my faith! you shall no more\nBe stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools\nBelieve false teachers: though those that\nare betray'd\nDo feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor\nStands in worse case of woe.\nAnd thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up\nMy disobedience 'gainst the king my father\nAnd make me put into contempt the suits\nOf princely fellows, shalt hereafter find\nIt is no act of common passage, but\nA strain of rareness: and I grieve myself\nTo think, when thou shalt be disedged by her\nThat now thou tirest on, how thy memory\nWill then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:\nThe lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?\nThou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,\nWhen I desire it too.\nDo't, and to bed then.\nWherefore then\nDidst undertake it? Why hast thou abused\nSo many miles with a pretence? this place?\nMine action and thine own? our horses' labour?\nThe time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,\nFor my being absent? whereunto I never\nPurpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,\nTo be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,\nThe elected deer before thee?\nTalk thy tongue weary; speak\nI have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear\nTherein false struck, can take no greater wound,\nNor tent to bottom that. But speak.\nMost like;\nBringing me here to kill me.\nSome Roman courtezan.\nWhy good fellow,\nWhat shall I do the where? where bide? how live?\nOr in my life what comfort, when I am\nDead to my husband?\nNo court, no father; nor no more ado\nWith that harsh, noble, simple nothing,\nThat Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me\nAs fearful as a siege.\nWhere then\nHath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,\nAre they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume\nOur Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;\nIn a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think\nThere's livers out of Britain.\nO, for such means!\nThough peril to my modesty, not death on't,\nI would adventure.\nNay, be brief\nI see into thy end, and am almost\nA man already.\nThou art all the comfort\nThe gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:\nThere's more to be consider'd; but we'll even\nAll that good time will give us: this attempt\nI am soldier to, and will abide it with\nA prince's courage. Away, I prithee.\nAmen: I thank thee.\nI see a man's life is a tedious one:\nI have tired myself, and for two nights together\nHave made the ground my bed. I should be sick,\nBut that my resolution helps me. Milford,\nWhen from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,\nThou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think\nFoundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,\nWhere they should be relieved. Two beggars told me\nI could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,\nThat have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis\nA punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,\nWhen rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness\nIs sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood\nIs worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!\nThou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,\nMy hunger's gone; but even before, I was\nAt point to sink for food. But what is this?\nHere is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:\nI were best not to call; I dare not call:\nyet famine,\nEre clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,\nPlenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever\nOf hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?\nIf any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,\nTake or lend. Ho! No answer?

But to the goal:\nMy last good deed was to entreat his stay:\nWhat was my first? it has an elder sister,\nOr I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!\nBut once before I spoke to the purpose: when?\nNay, let me have't; I long.\n'Tis grace indeed.\nWhy, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:\nThe one for ever earn'd a royal husband;\nThe other for some while a friend.\nHe something seems unsettled.\nYou look as if you held a brow of much distraction\nAre you moved, my lord?\nIf you would seek us,\nWe are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?\nTake the boy to you: he so troubles me,\n'Tis past enduring.\nWhat wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now\nI am for you again: pray you, sit by us,\nAnd tell 's a tale.\nAs merry as you will.\nLet's have that, good sir.\nCome on, sit down: come on, and do your best\nTo fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.\nNay, come, sit down; then on.\nCome on, then,\nAnd give't me in mine ear.\nWhat is this? sport?\nBut I'ld say he had not,\nAnd I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,\nHowe'er you lean to the nayward.\nShould a villain say so,\nThe most replenish'd villain in the world,\nHe were as much more villain: you, my lord,\nDo but mistake.\nNo, by my life.\nPrivy to none of this. How will this grieve you,\nWhen you shall come to clearer knowledge, that\nYou thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,\nYou scarce can right me throughly then to say\nYou did mistake.\nThere's some ill planet reigns:\nI must be patient till the heavens look\nWith an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,\nI am not prone to weeping, as our sex\nCommonly are; the want of which vain dew\nPerchance shall dry your pities: but I have\nThat honourable grief lodged here which burns\nWorse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,\nWith thoughts so qualified as your charities\nShall best instruct you, measure me; and so\nThe king's will be perform'd!\nWho is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,\nMy women may be with me; for you see\nMy plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;\nThere is no cause: when you shall know your mistress\nHas deserved prison, then abound in tears\nAs I come out: this action I now go on\nIs for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:\nI never wish'd to see you sorry; now\nI trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.\nSince what I am to say must be but that\nWhich contradicts my accusation and\nThe testimony on my part no other\nBut what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me\nTo say 'not guilty:' mine integrity\nBeing counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,\nBe so received. But thus: if powers divine\nBehold our human actions, as they do,\nI doubt not then but innocence shall make\nFalse accusation blush and tyranny\nTremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,\nWho least will seem to do so, my past life\nHath been as continent, as chaste, as true,\nAs I am now unhappy; which is more\nThan history can pattern, though devised\nAnd play'd to take spectators. For behold me\nA fellow of the royal bed, which owe\nA moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,\nThe mother to a hopeful prince, here standing\nTo prate and talk for life and honour 'fore\nWho please to come and hear. For life, I prize it\nAs I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,\n'Tis a derivative from me to mine,\nAnd only that I stand for. I appeal\nTo your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes\nCame to your court, how I was in your grace,\nHow merited to be so; since he came,\nWith what encounter so uncurrent I\nHave strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond\nThe bound of honour, or in act or will\nThat way inclining, harden'd be the hearts\nOf all that hear me, and my near'st of kin\nCry fie upon my grave!\nThat's true enough;\nThrough 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.\nMore than mistress of\nWhich comes to me in name of fault, I must not\nAt all acknowledge. For Polixenes,\nWith whom I am accused, I do confess\nI loved him as in honour he required,\nWith such a kind of love as might become\nA lady like me, with a love even such,\nSo and no other, as yourself commanded:\nWhich not to have done I think had been in me\nBoth disobedience and ingratitude\nTo you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,\nEven since it could speak, from an infant, freely\nThat it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,\nI know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd\nFor me to try how: all I know of it\nIs that Camillo was an honest man;\nAnd why he left your court, the gods themselves,\nWotting no more than I, are ignorant.\nSir,\nYou speak a language that I understand not:\nMy life stands in the level of your dreams,\nWhich I'll lay down.\nSir, spare your threats:\nThe bug which you would fright me with I seek.\nTo me can life be no commodity:\nThe crown and comfort of my life, your favour,\nI do give lost; for I do feel it gone,\nBut know not how it went. My second joy\nAnd first-fruits of my body, from his presence\nI am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort\nStarr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,\nThe innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,\nHaled out to murder: myself on every post\nProclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred\nThe child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs\nTo women of all fashion; lastly, hurried\nHere to this place, i' the open air, before\nI have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,\nTell me what blessings I have here alive,\nThat I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.\nBut yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,\nI prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,\nWhich I would free, if I shall be condemn'd\nUpon surmises, all proofs sleeping else\nBut what your jealousies awake, I tell you\n'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,\nI do refer me to the oracle:\nApollo be my judge!\nThe Emperor of Russia was my father:\nO that he were alive, and here beholding\nHis daughter's trial! that he did but see\nThe flatness of my misery, yet with eyes\nOf pity, not revenge!\nPraised!\nYou gods, look down\nAnd from your sacred vials pour your graces\nUpon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.\nWhere hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found\nThy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,\nKnowing by Paulina that the oracle\nGave hope thou wast in being, have preserved\nMyself to see the issue.\n", 'F'), ("How now! who calls?\nMadam, I am here.\nWhat is your will?\nAnd stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.\nIt is an honour that I dream not of.\nI'll look to like, if looking liking move:\nBut no more deep will I endart mine eye\nThan your consent gives strength to make it fly.\nGood pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\nWhich mannerly devotion shows in this;\nFor saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,\nAnd palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.\nAy, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.\nSaints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.\nThen have my lips the sin that they have took.\nYou kiss by the book.\nCome hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?\nWhat's he that now is going out of door?\nWhat's he that follows there, that would not dance?\nGo ask his name: if he be married.\nMy grave is like to be my wedding bed.\nMy only love sprung from my only hate!\nToo early seen unknown, and known too late!\nProdigious birth of love it is to me,\nThat I must love a loathed enemy.\nA rhyme I learn'd even now\nOf one I danced withal.\nAy me!\nO Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\nDeny thy father and refuse thy name;\nOr, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\nAnd I'll no longer be a Capulet.\n'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;\nThou art thyself, though not a Montague.\nWhat's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,\nNor arm, nor face, nor any other part\nBelonging to a man. O, be some other name!\nWhat's in a name? that which we call a rose\nBy any other name would smell as sweet;\nSo Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,\nRetain that dear perfection which he owes\nWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name,\nAnd for that name which is no part of thee\nTake all myself.\nWhat man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night\nSo stumblest on my counsel?\nMy ears have not yet drunk a hundred words\nOf that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:\nArt thou not Romeo and a Montague?\nHow camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\nThe orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\nAnd the place death, considering who thou art,\nIf any of my kinsmen find thee here.\nIf they do see thee, they will murder thee.\nI would not for the world they saw thee here.\nBy whose direction found'st thou out this place?\nThou know'st the mask of night is on my face,\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\nFor that which thou hast heard me speak to-night\nFain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny\nWhat I have spoke: but farewell compliment!\nDost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'\nAnd I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,\nThou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries\nThen say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:\nOr if thou think'st I am too quickly won,\nI'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,\nSo thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,\nAnd therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:\nBut trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true\nThan those that have more cunning to be strange.\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\nBut that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,\nMy true love's passion: therefore pardon me,\nAnd not impute this yielding to light love,\nWhich the dark night hath so discovered.\nO, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,\nThat monthly changes in her circled orb,\nLest that thy love prove likewise variable.\nDo not swear at all;\nOr, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\nWhich is the god of my idolatry,\nAnd I'll believe thee.\nWell, do not swear: although I joy in thee,\nI have no joy of this contract to-night:\nIt is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\nEre one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!\nThis bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,\nMay prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.\nGood night, good night! as sweet repose and rest\nCome to thy heart as that within my breast!\nWhat satisfaction canst thou have to-night?\nI gave thee mine before thou didst request it:\nAnd yet I would it were to give again.\nBut to be frank, and give it thee again.\nAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have:\nMy bounty is as boundless as the sea,\nMy love as deep; the more I give to thee,\nThe more I have, for both are infinite.\nI hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!\nAnon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.\nStay but a little, I will come again.\nThree words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\nIf that thy bent of love be honourable,\nThy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,\nBy one that I'll procure to come to thee,\nWhere and what time thou wilt perform the rite;\nAnd all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay\nAnd follow thee my lord throughout the world.\nI come, anon.\xe2\x80\x94But if thou mean'st not well,\nI do beseech thee\xe2\x80\x94\nBy and by, I come:\xe2\x80\x94\nTo cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:\nTo-morrow will I send.\nA thousand times good night!\nHist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,\nTo lure this tassel-gentle back again!\nBondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;\nElse would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\nAnd make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,\nWith repetition of my Romeo's name.\nRomeo!\nAt what o'clock to-morrow\nShall I send to thee?\nI will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.\nI have forgot why I did call thee back.\nI shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\nRemembering how I love thy company.\n'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:\nAnd yet no further than a wanton's bird;\nWho lets it hop a little from her hand,\nLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\nAnd with a silk thread plucks it back again,\nSo loving-jealous of his liberty.\nSweet, so would I:\nYet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\nGood night, good night! parting is such\nsweet sorrow,\nThat I shall say good night till it be morrow.\nThe clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;\nIn half an hour she promised to return.\nPerchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.\nO, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,\nWhich ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,\nDriving back shadows over louring hills:\nTherefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,\nAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\nNow is the sun upon the highmost hill\nOf this day's journey, and from nine till twelve\nIs three long hours, yet she is not come.\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,\nShe would be as swift in motion as a ball;\nMy words would bandy her to my sweet love,\nAnd his to me:\nBut old folks, many feign as they were dead;\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\nO God, she comes!\nO honey nurse, what news?\nHast thou met with him? Send thy man away.\nNow, good sweet nurse,\xe2\x80\x94O Lord, why look'st thou sad?\nThough news be sad, yet tell them merrily;\nIf good, thou shamest the music of sweet news\nBy playing it to me with so sour a face.\nI would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:\nNay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\nThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\nIs thy news good, or bad? answer to that;\nSay either, and I'll stay the circumstance:\nLet me be satisfied, is't good or bad?\nNo, no: but all this did I know before.\nWhat says he of our marriage? what of that?\nI' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\nSweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?\nWhere is my mother! why, she is within;\nWhere should she be? How oddly thou repliest!\n'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,\nWhere is your mother?'\nHere's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?\nI have.\nHie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\nConceit, more rich in matter than in words,\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament:\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth;\nBut my true love is grown to such excess\nI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\nGallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,\nTowards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner\nAs Phaethon would whip you to the west,\nAnd bring in cloudy night immediately.\nSpread thy close curtain, love-performing night,\nThat runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo\nLeap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.\nLovers can see to do their amorous rites\nBy their own beauties; or, if love be blind,\nIt best agrees with night. Come, civil night,\nThou sober-suited matron, all in black,\nAnd learn me how to lose a winning match,\nPlay'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:\nHood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,\nWith thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,\nThink true love acted simple modesty.\nCome, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;\nFor thou wilt lie upon the wings of night\nWhiter than new snow on a raven's back.\nCome, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,\nGive me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,\nTake him and cut him out in little stars,\nAnd he will make the face of heaven so fine\nThat all the world will be in love with night\nAnd pay no worship to the garish sun.\nO, I have bought the mansion of a love,\nBut not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,\nNot yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day\nAs is the night before some festival\nTo an impatient child that hath new robes\nAnd may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,\nAnd she brings news; and every tongue that speaks\nBut Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.\nNow, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords\nThat Romeo bid thee fetch?\nAy me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?\nCan heaven be so envious?\nWhat devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?\nThis torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.\nHath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'\nAnd that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more\nThan the death-darting eye of cockatrice:\nI am not I, if there be such an I;\nOr those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'\nIf he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:\nBrief sounds determine of my weal or woe.\nO, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!\nTo prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!\nVile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;\nAnd thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!\nWhat storm is this that blows so contrary?\nIs Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?\nMy dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?\nThen, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!\nFor who is living, if those two are gone?\nO God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?\nO serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!\nDid ever dragon keep so fair a cave?\nBeautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!\nDove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!\nDespised substance of divinest show!\nJust opposite to what thou justly seem'st,\nA damned saint, an honourable villain!\nO nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,\nWhen thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend\nIn moral paradise of such sweet flesh?\nWas ever book containing such vile matter\nSo fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell\nIn such a gorgeous palace!\nBlister'd be thy tongue\nFor such a wish! he was not born to shame:\nUpon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;\nFor 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd\nSole monarch of the universal earth.\nO, what a beast was I to chide at him!\nShall I speak ill of him that is my husband?\nAh, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,\nWhen I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?\nBut, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?\nThat villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:\nBack, foolish tears, back to your native spring;\nYour tributary drops belong to woe,\nWhich you, mistaking, offer up to joy.\nMy husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;\nAnd Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:\nAll this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?\nSome word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,\nThat murder'd me: I would forget it fain;\nBut, O, it presses to my memory,\nLike damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:\n'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo\xe2\x80\x94banished;'\nThat 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'\nHath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death\nWas woe enough, if it had ended there:\nOr, if sour woe delights in fellowship\nAnd needly will be rank'd with other griefs,\nWhy follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'\nThy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,\nWhich modern lamentations might have moved?\nBut with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,\n'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,\nIs father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,\nAll slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'\nThere is no end, no limit, measure, bound,\nIn that word's death; no words can that woe sound.\nWhere is my father, and my mother, nurse?\nWash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,\nWhen theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.\nTake up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,\nBoth you and I; for Romeo is exiled:\nHe made you for a highway to my bed;\nBut I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.\nCome, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;\nAnd death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!\nO, find him! give this ring to my true knight,\nAnd bid him come to take his last farewell.\nWilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:\nIt was the nightingale, and not the lark,\nThat pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;\nNightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:\nBelieve me, love, it was the nightingale.\nYon light is not day-light, I know it, I:\nIt is some meteor that the sun exhales,\nTo be to thee this night a torch-bearer,\nAnd light thee on thy way to Mantua:\nTherefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.\nIt is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!\nIt is the lark that sings so out of tune,\nStraining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.\nSome say the lark makes sweet division;\nThis doth not so, for she divideth us:\nSome say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,\nO, now I would they had changed voices too!\nSince arm from arm that voice doth us affray,\nHunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,\nO, now be gone; more light and light it grows.\nNurse?\nThen, window, let day in, and let life out.\nArt thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!\nI must hear from thee every day in the hour,\nFor in a minute there are many days:\nO, by this count I shall be much in years\nEre I again behold my Romeo!\nO think'st thou we shall ever meet again?\nO God, I have an ill-divining soul!\nMethinks I see thee, now thou art below,\nAs one dead in the bottom of a tomb:\nEither my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.\nO fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:\nIf thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.\nThat is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;\nFor then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,\nBut send him back.\nWho is't that calls? is it my lady mother?\nIs she not down so late, or up so early?\nWhat unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?\nMadam, I am not well.\nYet let me weep for such a feeling loss.\nFeeling so the loss,\nCannot choose but ever weep the friend.\nWhat villain madam?\nVillain and he be many miles asunder.\xe2\x80\x94\nGod Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;\nAnd yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.\nAy, madam, from the reach of these my hands:\nWould none but I might venge my cousin's death!\nIndeed, I never shall be satisfied\nWith Romeo, till I behold him\xe2\x80\x94dead\xe2\x80\x94\nIs my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.\nMadam, if you could find out but a man\nTo bear a poison, I would temper it;\nThat Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,\nSoon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors\nTo hear him named, and cannot come to him.\nTo wreak the love I bore my cousin\nUpon his body that slaughter'd him!\nAnd joy comes well in such a needy time:\nWhat are they, I beseech your ladyship?\nMadam, in happy time, what day is that?\nNow, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,\nHe shall not make me there a joyful bride.\nI wonder at this haste; that I must wed\nEre he, that should be husband, comes to woo.\nI pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,\nI will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,\nIt shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,\nRather than Paris. These are news indeed!\nNot proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:\nProud can I never be of what I hate;\nBut thankful even for hate, that is meant love.\nGood father, I beseech you on my knees,\nHear me with patience but to speak a word.\nIs there no pity sitting in the clouds,\nThat sees into the bottom of my grief?\nO, sweet my mother, cast me not away!\nDelay this marriage for a month, a week;\nOr, if you do not, make the bridal bed\nIn that dim monument where Tybalt lies.\nO God!\xe2\x80\x94O nurse, how shall this be prevented?\nMy husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;\nHow shall that faith return again to earth,\nUnless that husband send it me from heaven\nBy leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.\nAlack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems\nUpon so soft a subject as myself!\nWhat say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?\nSome comfort, nurse.\nSpeakest thou from thy heart?\nAmen!\nWell, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.\nGo in: and tell my lady I am gone,\nHaving displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,\nTo make confession and to be absolved.\nAncient damnation!

To whom should this be?\nJove knows I love: But who?\nLips, do not move;\nNo man must know.\n'No man must know.' What follows? the numbers\naltered! 'No man must know:' if this should be\nthee, Malvolio?\nI may command where I adore;\nBut silence, like a Lucrece knife,\nWith bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:\nM, O, A, I, doth sway my life.\n'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let\nme see, let me see, let me see.\n'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command\nme: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is\nevident to any formal capacity; there is no\nobstruction in this: and the end,\xe2\x80\x94what should\nthat alphabetical position portend? If I could make\nthat resemble something in me,\xe2\x80\x94Softly! M, O, A,\nI,\xe2\x80\x94\nM,\xe2\x80\x94Malvolio; M,\xe2\x80\x94why, that begins my name.\nM,\xe2\x80\x94but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;\nthat suffers under probation A should follow but O does.\nAnd then I comes behind.\nM, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: and\nyet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for\nevery one of these letters are in my name. Soft!\nhere follows prose.\n'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I\nam above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some\nare born great, some achieve greatness, and some\nhave greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open\ntheir hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;\nand, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,\ncast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be\nopposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let\nthy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into\nthe trick of singularity: she thus advises thee\nthat sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy\nyellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever\ncross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art\nmade, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see\nthee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and\nnot worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.\nShe that would alter services with thee,\nTHE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'\nDaylight and champaign discovers not more: this is\nopen. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,\nI will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross\nacquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.\nI do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade\nme; for every reason excites to this, that my lady\nloves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of\nlate, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;\nand in this she manifests herself to my love, and\nwith a kind of injunction drives me to these habits\nof her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will\nbe strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and\ncross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting\non. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a\npostscript.\n'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou\nentertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;\nthy smiles become thee well; therefore in my\npresence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'\nJove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do\neverything that thou wilt have me.\nSweet lady, ho, ho.\nSad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some\nobstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but\nwhat of that? if it please the eye of one, it is\nwith me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and\nplease all.'\nNot black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It\ndid come to his hands, and commands shall be\nexecuted: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.\nTo bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.\nAt your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.\n'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.\n'Some are born great,'\xe2\x80\x94\n'Some achieve greatness,'\xe2\x80\x94\n'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'\n'Remember who commended thy yellow stockings,'\xe2\x80\x94\n'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'\n'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'\xe2\x80\x94\n'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'\nO, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than\nSir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with\nthe letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may\nappear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that\nin the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;\n'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;\nlet thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put\nthyself into the trick of singularity;' and\nconsequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad\nface, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the\nhabit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have\nlimed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me\nthankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this\nfellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor\nafter my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing\nadheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no\nscruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous\nor unsafe circumstance\xe2\x80\x94What can be said? Nothing\nthat can be can come between me and the full\nprospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the\ndoer of this, and he is to be thanked.\nGo off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go\noff.\nAh, ha! does she so?\nDo you know what you say?\nHow now, mistress!\nSir!\nMy prayers, minx!\nGo, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow\nthings: I am not of your element: you shall know\nmore hereafter.\nWho calls there?\nSir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.\nSir Topas, never was man thus wronged: good Sir\nTopas, do not think I am mad: they have laid me\nhere in hideous darkness.\nAs hell, Sir Topas.\nI am not mad, Sir Topas: I say to you, this house is dark.\nI say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though\nignorance were as dark as hell; and I say, there\nwas never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you\nare: make the trial of it in any constant question.\nThat the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.\nI think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.\nSir Topas, Sir Topas!\nFool!\nFool!\nFool, I say!\nGood fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my\nhand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink and paper:\nas I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to\nthee for't.\nAy, good fool.\nFool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: I\nam as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.\nThey have here propertied me; keep me in darkness,\nsend ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to\nface me out of my wits.\nSir Topas!\nFool, fool, fool, I say!\nGood fool, help me to some light and some paper: I\ntell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.\nBy this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper and\nlight; and convey what I will set down to my lady:\nit shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing\nof letter did.\nBelieve me, I am not; I tell thee true.\nFool, I'll requite it in the highest degree: I\nprithee, be gone.\nMadam, you have done me wrong,\nNotorious wrong.\nLady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.\nYou must not now deny it is your hand:\nWrite from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;\nOr say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:\nYou can say none of this: well, grant it then\nAnd tell me, in the modesty of honour,\nWhy you have given me such clear lights of favour,\nBade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,\nTo put on yellow stockings and to frown\nUpon Sir Toby and the lighter people;\nAnd, acting this in an obedient hope,\nWhy have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,\nKept in a dark house, visited by the priest,\nAnd made the most notorious geck and gull\nThat e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.\nI'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.\n", 'M')]
