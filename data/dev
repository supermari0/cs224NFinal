O, vengeance, vengeance!\nMe of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd\nAnd pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with\nA pudency so rosy the sweet view on't\nMight well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her\nAs chaste as unsunn'd snow.

Could I find out\nThe woman's part in me! For there's no motion\nThat tends to vice in man, but I affirm\nIt is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,\nThe woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;\nLust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;\nAmbitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,\nNice longing, slanders, mutability,\nAll faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,\nWhy, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;\nFor even to vice\nThey are not constant but are changing still\nOne vice, but of a minute old, for one\nNot half so old as that. I'll write against them,\nDetest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill\nIn a true hate, to pray they have their will:\nThe very devils cannot plague them better.\nYea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd\nThou shouldst be colour'd thus.

O Pisanio!\nEvery good servant does not all commands:\nNo bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you\nShould have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never\nHad lived to put on this: so had you saved\nThe noble Imogen to repent, and struck\nMe, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,\nYou snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,\nTo have them fall no more: you some permit\nTo second ills with ills, each elder worse,\nAnd make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.\nBut Imogen is your own: do your best wills,\nAnd make me blest to obey! I am brought hither\nAmong the Italian gentry, and to fight\nAgainst my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough\nThat, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!\nI'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,\nHear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me\nOf these Italian weeds and suit myself\nAs does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight\nAgainst the part I come with; so I'll die\nFor thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life\nIs every breath a death; and thus, unknown,\nPitied nor hated, to the face of peril\nMyself I'll dedicate.

Stand;\nOr we are Romans and will give you that\nLike beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,\nBut to look back in frown: stand, stand.'\nThese three,\nThree thousand confident, in act as many\xe2\x80\x94\nFor three performers are the file when all\nThe rest do nothing\xe2\x80\x94with this word 'Stand, stand,'\nAccommodated by the place, more charming\nWith their own nobleness, which could have turn'd\nA distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,\nPart shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,\nturn'd coward\nBut by example\xe2\x80\x94O, a sin in war,\nDamn'd in the first beginners!\xe2\x80\x94gan to look\nThe way that they did, and to grin like lions\nUpon the pikes o' the hunters.

Here is one:\n'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,\nPreserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'\n'Lack, to what end?\nWho dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;\nFor if he'll do as he is made to do,\nI know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.\nYou have put me into rhyme.\nStill going?\nThis is a lord! O noble misery,\nTo be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!\nTo-day how many would have given their honours\nTo have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,\nAnd yet died too!

Well, I will find him\nFor being now a favourer to the Briton,\nNo more a Briton, I have resumed again\nThe part I came in: fight I will no more,\nBut yield me to the veriest hind that shall\nOnce touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is\nHere made by the Roman; great the answer be\nBritons must take.

My conscience, thou art fetter'd\nMore than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me\nThe penitent instrument to pick that bolt,\nThen, free for ever!

Come, I\ncannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a\nmany of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like\nwomen in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury\nin simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none\nbut thee; and thou deservest it.\nThou mightst as well say I love to walk by the\nCounter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek\nof a lime-kiln.\nKeep in that mind; I'll deserve it.\nShe shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras.\nLet me see't, let me see't, O, let\nme see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's\ncounsel. I'll in.\nI love thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here.\nI'll never\xe2\x80\x94\nBardolph, I say,\xe2\x80\x94\nGo fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.\nHave I lived to be carried in a basket, like a\nbarrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the\nThames? Well, if I be served such another trick,\nI'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give\nthem to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues\nslighted me into the river with as little remorse as\nthey would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,\nfifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size\nthat I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the\nbottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had\nbeen drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and\nshallow,\xe2\x80\x94a death that I abhor; for the water swells\na man; and what a thing should I have been when I\nhad been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.\nLet me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for my\nbelly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for\npills to cool the reins. Call her in.\nTake away these chalices. Go brew me a pottle of\nsack finely.\nSimple of itself; I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.\nHow now!\nMistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown\ninto the ford; I have my belly full of ford.\nSo did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.\nWell, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid her\nthink what a man is: let her consider his frailty,\nand then judge of my merit.\nDo so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?\nWell, be gone: I will not miss her.\nI marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word\nto stay within: I like his money well. O, here he comes.\nNow, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed\nbetween me and Ford's wife?\nMaster Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her\nhouse the hour she appointed me.\nVery ill-favoredly, Master Brook.\nNo, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her\nhusband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual\n'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our\nencounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,\nand, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;\nand at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither\nprovoked and instigated by his distemper, and,\nforsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.\nWhile I was there.\nYou shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes\nin one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's\napproach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's\ndistraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.\nBy the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul\nshirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy\nnapkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest\ncompound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.\nNay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have\nsuffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.\nBeing thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's\nknaves, his hinds, were called forth by their\nmistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to\nDatchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met\nthe jealous knave their master in the door, who\nasked them once or twice what they had in their\nbasket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave\nwould have searched it; but fate, ordaining he\nshould be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he\nfor a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But\nmark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs\nof three several deaths; first, an intolerable\nfright, to be detected with a jealous rotten\nbell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good\nbilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to\npoint, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,\nlike a strong distillation, with stinking clothes\nthat fretted in their own grease: think of that,\xe2\x80\x94a\nman of my kidney,\xe2\x80\x94think of that,\xe2\x80\x94that am as subject\nto heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution\nand thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.\nAnd in the height of this bath, when I was more than\nhalf stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be\nthrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,\nin that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of\nthat,\xe2\x80\x94hissing hot,\xe2\x80\x94think of that, Master Brook.\nMaster Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have\nbeen into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her\nhusband is this morning gone a-birding: I have\nreceived from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt\neight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.\nIs it? I will then address me to my appointment.\nCome to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall\nknow how I speed; and the conclusion shall be\ncrowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall\nhave her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall\ncuckold Ford.\nMistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my\nsufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love,\nand I profess requital to a hair's breadth; not\nonly, Mistress Ford, in the simple\noffice of love, but in all the accoutrement,\ncomplement and ceremony of it. But are you\nsure of your husband now?\nNo, I'll come no more i' the basket. May I not go\nout ere he come?\nWhat shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.\nWhere is it?\nI'll go out then.\nGood hearts, devise something: any extremity rather\nthan a mischief.\nHow now, mine host!\nThere was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with\nme; but she's gone.\nAy, marry, was it, mussel-shell: what would you with her?\nI spake with the old woman about it.\nMarry, she says that the very same man that\nbeguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of\nit.\nWhat are they? let us know.\n'Tis, 'tis his fortune.\nTo have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me so.\nAy, sir; like who more bold.\nAy, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught\nme more wit than ever I learned before in my life;\nand I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for\nmy learning.\nI would all the world might be cozened; for I have\nbeen cozened and beaten too. If it should come to\nthe ear of the court, how I have been transformed\nand how my transformation hath been washed and\ncudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by\ndrop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant\nthey would whip me with their fine wits till I were\nas crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered\nsince I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my\nwind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.\nNow, whence come you?\nThe devil take one party and his dam the other! and\nso they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more\nfor their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy\nof man's disposition is able to bear.\nWhat tellest thou me of black and blue? I was\nbeaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;\nand I was like to be apprehended for the witch of\nBrentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,\nmy counterfeiting the action of an old woman,\ndelivered me, the knave constable had set me i' the\nstocks, i' the common stocks, for a witch.\nCome up into my chamber.\nPrithee, no more prattling; go. I'll hold. This is\nthe third time; I hope good luck lies in odd\nnumbers. Away I go. They say there is divinity in\nodd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!\nAway, I say; time wears: hold up your head, and mince.\nHow now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the matter\nwill be known to-night, or never. Be you in the\nPark about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall\nsee wonders.\nI went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor\nold man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like a\npoor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband,\nhath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,\nMaster Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell\nyou: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a\nwoman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear\nnot Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know\nalso life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along\nwith me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I\nplucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew\nnot what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow\nme: I'll tell you strange things of this knave\nFord, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I\nwill deliver his wife into your hand. Follow.\nStrange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.\nThe Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute\ndraws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!\nRemember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love\nset on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some\nrespects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man\na beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love\nof Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew\nto the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in\nthe form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And\nthen another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think\non 't, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot\nbacks, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a\nWindsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the\nforest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can\nblame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? my\ndoe?\nMy doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain\npotatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green\nSleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; let\nthere come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.\nDivide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I will\nkeep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow\nof this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands.\nAm I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter?\nWhy, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes\nrestitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome!\nWhat should this be?\nI think the devil will not have me damned, lest the\noil that's in me should set hell on fire; he would\nnever else cross me thus.\nThey are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die:\nI'll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.\nHeavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he\ntransform me to a piece of cheese!\nOh, Oh, Oh!\nI do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.\nAnd these are not fairies? I was three or four\ntimes in the thought they were not fairies: and yet\nthe guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my\npowers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a\nreceived belief, in despite of the teeth of all\nrhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now\nhow wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon\nill employment!\nHave I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that\nit wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as\nthis? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I\nhave a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked\nwith a piece of toasted cheese.\n'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the\ntaunt of one that makes fritters of English? This\nis enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking\nthrough the realm.\nWell, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I\nam dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh\nflannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use\nme as you will.\nI am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to\nstrike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.\nWhen night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.\n", 'M'), ("And have you nuns no farther privileges?\nYes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;\nBut rather wishing a more strict restraint\nUpon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.\nWho's that which calls?\nPeace and prosperity! Who is't that calls\nWhy 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,\nThe rather for I now must make you know\nI am that Isabella and his sister.\nWoe me! for what?\nSir, make me not your story.\nYou do blaspheme the good in mocking me.\nSome one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?\nAdoptedly; as school-maids change their names\nBy vain though apt affection.\nO, let him marry her.\nDoth he so seek his life?\nAlas! what poor ability's in me\nTo do him good?\nMy power? Alas, I doubt\xe2\x80\x94\nI'll see what I can do.\nI will about it straight;\nNo longer staying but to give the mother\nNotice of my affair. I humbly thank you:\nCommend me to my brother: soon at night\nI'll send him certain word of my success.\nGood sir, adieu.\nI am a woeful suitor to your honour,\nPlease but your honour hear me.\nThere is a vice that most I do abhor,\nAnd most desire should meet the blow of justice;\nFor which I would not plead, but that I must;\nFor which I must not plead, but that I am\nAt war 'twixt will and will not.\nI have a brother is condemn'd to die:\nI do beseech you, let it be his fault,\nAnd not my brother.\nO just but severe law!\nI had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!\nMust he needs die?\nYes; I do think that you might pardon him,\nAnd neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.\nBut can you, if you would?\nBut might you do't, and do the world no wrong,\nIf so your heart were touch'd with that remorse\nAs mine is to him?\nToo late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.\nMay call it back again. Well, believe this,\nNo ceremony that to great ones 'longs,\nNot the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,\nThe marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,\nBecome them with one half so good a grace\nAs mercy does.\nIf he had been as you and you as he,\nYou would have slipt like him; but he, like you,\nWould not have been so stern.\nI would to heaven I had your potency,\nAnd you were Isabel! should it then be thus?\nNo; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,\nAnd what a prisoner.\nAlas, alas!\nWhy, all the souls that were were forfeit once;\nAnd He that might the vantage best have took\nFound out the remedy. How would you be,\nIf He, which is the top of judgment, should\nBut judge you as you are? O, think on that;\nAnd mercy then will breathe within your lips,\nLike man new made.\nTo-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!\nHe's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens\nWe kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven\nWith less respect than we do minister\nTo our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;\nWho is it that hath died for this offence?\nThere's many have committed it.\nYet show some pity.\nSo you must be the first that gives this sentence,\nAnd he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent\nTo have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous\nTo use it like a giant.\nCould great men thunder\nAs Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,\nFor every pelting, petty officer\nWould use his heaven for thunder;\nNothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,\nThou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt\nSplit'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak\nThan the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,\nDrest in a little brief authority,\nMost ignorant of what he's most assured,\nHis glassy essence, like an angry ape,\nPlays such fantastic tricks before high heaven\nAs make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,\nWould all themselves laugh mortal.\nWe cannot weigh our brother with ourself:\nGreat men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,\nBut in the less foul profanation.\nThat in the captain's but a choleric word,\nWhich in the soldier is flat blasphemy.\nBecause authority, though it err like others,\nHath yet a kind of medicine in itself,\nThat skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;\nKnock there, and ask your heart what it doth know\nThat's like my brother's fault: if it confess\nA natural guiltiness such as is his,\nLet it not sound a thought upon your tongue\nAgainst my brother's life.\nGentle my lord, turn back.\nHark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.\nAy, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.\nNot with fond shekels of the tested gold,\nOr stones whose rates are either rich or poor\nAs fancy values them; but with true prayers\nThat shall be up at heaven and enter there\nEre sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,\nFrom fasting maids whose minds are dedicate\nTo nothing temporal.\nHeaven keep your honour safe!\nAt what hour to-morrow\nShall I attend your lordship?\n'Save your honour!\nI am come to know your pleasure.\nEven so. Heaven keep your honour!\nUnder your sentence?\nWhen, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,\nLonger or shorter, he may be so fitted\nThat his soul sicken not.\n'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.\nSir, believe this,\nI had rather give my body than my soul.\nHow say you?\nPlease you to do't,\nI'll take it as a peril to my soul,\nIt is no sin at all, but charity.\nThat I do beg his life, if it be sin,\nHeaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,\nIf that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer\nTo have it added to the faults of mine,\nAnd nothing of your answer.\nLet me be ignorant, and in nothing good,\nBut graciously to know I am no better.\nSo.\nTrue.\nAs much for my poor brother as myself:\nThat is, were I under the terms of death,\nThe impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,\nAnd strip myself to death, as to a bed\nThat longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield\nMy body up to shame.\nAnd 'twere the cheaper way:\nBetter it were a brother died at once,\nThan that a sister, by redeeming him,\nShould die for ever.\nIgnomy in ransom and free pardon\nAre of two houses: lawful mercy\nIs nothing kin to foul redemption.\nO, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,\nTo have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:\nI something do excuse the thing I hate,\nFor his advantage that I dearly love.\nElse let my brother die,\nIf not a feodary, but only he\nOwe and succeed thy weakness.\nAy, as the glasses where they view themselves;\nWhich are as easy broke as they make forms.\nWomen! Help Heaven! men their creation mar\nIn profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;\nFor we are soft as our complexions are,\nAnd credulous to false prints.\nI have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,\nLet me entreat you speak the former language.\nMy brother did love Juliet,\nAnd you tell me that he shall die for it.\nI know your virtue hath a licence in't,\nWhich seems a little fouler than it is,\nTo pluck on others.\nHa! little honour to be much believed,\nAnd most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!\nI will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:\nSign me a present pardon for my brother,\nOr with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud\nWhat man thou art.\nTo whom should I complain? Did I tell this,\nWho would believe me? O perilous mouths,\nThat bear in them one and the self-same tongue,\nEither of condemnation or approof;\nBidding the law make court'sy to their will:\nHooking both right and wrong to the appetite,\nTo follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:\nThough he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,\nYet hath he in him such a mind of honour.\nThat, had he twenty heads to tender down\nOn twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,\nBefore his sister should her body stoop\nTo such abhorr'd pollution.\nThen, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:\nMore than our brother is our chastity.\nI'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,\nAnd fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.\nWhat, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!\nMy business is a word or two with Claudio.\nWhy,\nAs all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.\nLord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,\nIntends you for his swift ambassador,\nWhere you shall be an everlasting leiger:\nTherefore your best appointment make with speed;\nTo-morrow you set on.\nNone, but such remedy as, to save a head,\nTo cleave a heart in twain.\nYes, brother, you may live:\nThere is a devilish mercy in the judge,\nIf you'll implore it, that will free your life,\nBut fetter you till death.\nAy, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,\nThough all the world's vastidity you had,\nTo a determined scope.\nIn such a one as, you consenting to't,\nWould bark your honour from that trunk you bear,\nAnd leave you naked.\nO, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,\nLest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,\nAnd six or seven winters more respect\nThan a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?\nThe sense of death is most in apprehension;\nAnd the poor beetle, that we tread upon,\nIn corporal sufferance finds a pang as great\nAs when a giant dies.\nThere spake my brother; there my father's grave\nDid utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:\nThou art too noble to conserve a life\nIn base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,\nWhose settled visage and deliberate word\nNips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew\nAs falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil\nHis filth within being cast, he would appear\nA pond as deep as hell.\nO, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,\nThe damned'st body to invest and cover\nIn prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?\nIf I would yield him my virginity,\nThou mightst be freed.\nYes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,\nSo to offend him still. This night's the time\nThat I should do what I abhor to name,\nOr else thou diest to-morrow.\nO, were it but my life,\nI'ld throw it down for your deliverance\nAs frankly as a pin.\nBe ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.\nWhich is the least?\nWhat says my brother?\nAnd shamed life a hateful.\nAlas, alas!\nO you beast!\nO faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!\nWilt thou be made a man out of my vice?\nIs't not a kind of incest, to take life\nFrom thine own sister's shame? What should I think?\nHeaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!\nFor such a warped slip of wilderness\nNe'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!\nDie, perish! Might but my bending down\nReprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:\nI'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,\nNo word to save thee.\nO, fie, fie, fie!\nThy sin's not accidental, but a trade.\nMercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:\n'Tis best thou diest quickly.\nWhat is your will?\nI have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be\nstolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.\nI am now going to resolve him: I had rather my\nbrother die by the law than my son should be\nunlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke\ndeceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can\nspeak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or\ndiscover his government.\nLet me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do\nanything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.\nI have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.\nCan this be so? did Angelo so leave her?\nWhat a merit were it in death to take this poor maid\nfrom the world! What corruption in this life, that\nit will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?\nShow me how, good father.\nThe image of it gives me content already; and I\ntrust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.\nI thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.\nHe hath a garden circummured with brick,\nWhose western side is with a vineyard back'd;\nAnd to that vineyard is a planched gate,\nThat makes his opening with this bigger key:\nThis other doth command a little door\nWhich from the vineyard to the garden leads;\nThere have I made my promise\nUpon the heavy middle of the night\nTo call upon him.\nI have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:\nWith whispering and most guilty diligence,\nIn action all of precept, he did show me\nThe way twice o'er.\nNo, none, but only a repair i' the dark;\nAnd that I have possess'd him my most stay\nCan be but brief; for I have made him know\nI have a servant comes with me along,\nThat stays upon me, whose persuasion is\nI come about my brother.\nI do desire the like.\nShe'll take the enterprise upon her, father,\nIf you advise it.\nLittle have you to say\nWhen you depart from him, but, soft and low,\n'Remember now my brother.'\nPeace, ho, be here!\nHo, by your leave!\nThe better, given me by so holy a man.\nHath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?\nNay, but it is not so.\nO, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!\nUnhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!\nInjurious world! most damned Angelo!\nI am directed by you.\nTo speak so indirectly I am loath:\nI would say the truth; but to accuse him so,\nThat is your part: yet I am advised to do it;\nHe says, to veil full purpose.\nBesides, he tells me that, if peradventure\nHe speak against me on the adverse side,\nI should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic\nThat's bitter to sweet end.\nO, peace! the friar is come.\nJustice, O royal duke! Vail your regard\nUpon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!\nO worthy prince, dishonour not your eye\nBy throwing it on any other object\nTill you have heard me in my true complaint\nAnd given me justice, justice, justice, justice!\nO worthy duke,\nYou bid me seek redemption of the devil:\nHear me yourself; for that which I must speak\nMust either punish me, not being believed,\nOr wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!\nBy course of justice!\nMost strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:\nThat Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?\nThat Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?\nThat Angelo is an adulterous thief,\nAn hypocrite, a virgin-violator;\nIs it not strange and strange?\nIt is not truer he is Angelo\nThan this is all as true as it is strange:\nNay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth\nTo the end of reckoning.\nO prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest\nThere is another comfort than this world,\nThat thou neglect me not, with that opinion\nThat I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible\nThat which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible\nBut one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,\nMay seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute\nAs Angelo; even so may Angelo,\nIn all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,\nBe an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:\nIf he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,\nHad I more name for badness.\nO gracious duke,\nHarp not on that, nor do not banish reason\nFor inequality; but let your reason serve\nTo make the truth appear where it seems hid,\nAnd hide the false seems true.\nI am the sister of one Claudio,\nCondemn'd upon the act of fornication\nTo lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:\nI, in probation of a sisterhood,\nWas sent to by my brother; one Lucio\nAs then the messenger,\xe2\x80\x94\nThat's he indeed.\nThis gentleman told somewhat of my tale,\xe2\x80\x94\nI went\nTo this pernicious caitiff deputy,\xe2\x80\x94\nPardon it;\nThe phrase is to the matter.\nIn brief, to set the needless process by,\nHow I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,\nHow he refell'd me, and how I replied,\xe2\x80\x94\nFor this was of much length,\xe2\x80\x94the vile conclusion\nI now begin with grief and shame to utter:\nHe would not, but by gift of my chaste body\nTo his concupiscible intemperate lust,\nRelease my brother; and, after much debatement,\nMy sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,\nAnd I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,\nHis purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant\nFor my poor brother's head.\nO, that it were as like as it is true!\nAnd is this all?\nThen, O you blessed ministers above,\nKeep me in patience, and with ripen'd time\nUnfold the evil which is here wrapt up\nIn countenance!
