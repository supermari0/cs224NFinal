The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
And much too little of that good I saw
Is my report to his great worthiness.
Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
And so she died: had she been light, like you,
Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:
And so may you; for a light heart lives long.
A light condition in a beauty dark.
You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.
So do not you, for you are a light wench.
You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.
Madam, this glove.
Yes, madam, and moreover
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.
But in this changing what is your intent?
What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.
Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
No, a fair lord calf.
No, I'll not be your half
Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.
Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;
And trow you what he called me?
Yes, in good faith.
And Longaville was for my service born.
A beard, fair health, and honesty;
With three-fold love I wish you all these three.
Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
Come when the king doth to my lady come;
Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
