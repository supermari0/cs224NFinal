I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,
Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:
A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;
Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;
Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
It should none spare that come within his power.
They say so most that most his humours know.
That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:
Not a word with him but a jest.
Two hot sheeps, marry.
You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?
Not so, gentle beast:
My lips are no common, though several they be.
To my fortunes and me.
He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.
No.
You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes
at the brow.
A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.
Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith, your hand is out.
Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.
This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
The letter is too long by half a mile.
Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;
Since all the power thereof it doth apply
To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.
Name it.
Say you so? Fair lord,â€”
Take that for your fair lady.
Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
At the twelvemonth's end
I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
The liker you; few taller are so young.
