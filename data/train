[("Well, I hope it be not so.\nWhy, sir, my wife is not young.\nLove my wife!\nWhat name, sir?\nI will be patient; I will find out this.\nI will seek out Falstaff.\nIf I do find it: well.\n'Twas a good sensible fellow: well.\nI melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you home, go.\nYou heard what this knave told me, did you not?\nDo you think there is truth in them?\nWere they his men?\nI like it never the better for that. Does he lie at\nthe Garter?\nI do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to\nturn them together. A man may be too confident: I\nwould have nothing lie on my head: I cannot be thus satisfied.\nGood mine host o' the Garter, a word with you.\nNone, I protest: but I'll give you a pottle of\nburnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him\nmy name is Brook; only for a jest.\nThough Page be a secure fool, an stands so firmly\non his wife's frailty, yet I cannot put off my\nopinion so easily: she was in his company at Page's\nhouse; and what they made there, I know not. Well,\nI will look further into't: and I have a disguise\nto sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not\nmy labour; if she be otherwise, 'tis labour well bestowed.\nBless you, sir!\nI make bold to press with so little preparation upon\nyou.\nSir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.\nGood Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;\nfor I must let you understand I think myself in\nbetter plight for a lender than you are: the which\nhath something embolden'd me to this unseasoned\nintrusion; for they say, if money go before, all\nways do lie open.\nTroth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me:\nif you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or\nhalf, for easing me of the carriage.\nI will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.\nSir, I hear you are a scholar,\xe2\x80\x94I will be brief\nwith you,\xe2\x80\x94and you have been a man long known to me,\nthough I had never so good means, as desire, to make\nmyself acquainted with you. I shall discover a\nthing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine\nown imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have\none eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,\nturn another into the register of your own; that I\nmay pass with a reproof the easier, sith you\nyourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.\nThere is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's\nname is Ford.\nI have long loved her, and, I protest to you,\nbestowed much on her; followed her with a doting\nobservance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;\nfee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly\ngive me sight of her; not only bought many presents\nto give her, but have given largely to many to know\nwhat she would have given; briefly, I have pursued\nher as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the\nwing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have\nmerited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,\nI am sure, I have received none; unless experience\nbe a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite\nrate, and that hath taught me to say this:\n'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;\nPursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'\nNever.\nNever.\nLike a fair house built on another man's ground; so\nthat I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place\nwhere I erected it.\nWhen I have told you that, I have told you all.\nSome say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in\nother places she enlargeth her mirth so far that\nthere is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir\nJohn, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a\ngentleman of excellent breeding, admirable\ndiscourse, of great admittance, authentic in your\nplace and person, generally allowed for your many\nwar-like, court-like, and learned preparations.\nBelieve it, for you know it. There is money; spend\nit, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only\ngive me so much of your time in exchange of it, as\nto lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this\nFord's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to\nconsent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as\nany.\nO, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on\nthe excellency of her honour, that the folly of my\nsoul dares not present itself: she is too bright to\nbe looked against. Now, could I could come to her\nwith any detection in my hand, my desires had\ninstance and argument to commend themselves: I\ncould drive her then from the ward of her purity,\nher reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand\nother her defences, which now are too too strongly\nembattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?\nO good sir!\nWant no money, Sir John; you shall want none.\nI am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,\nsir?\nI would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him\nif you saw him.\nWhat a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is\nready to crack with impatience. Who says this is\nimprovident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the\nhour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man\nhave thought this? See the hell of having a false\nwoman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers\nransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not\nonly receive this villanous wrong, but stand under\nthe adoption of abominable terms, and by him that\ndoes me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds\nwell; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are\ndevils' additions, the names of fiends: but\nCuckold! Wittol!\xe2\x80\x94Cuckold! the devil himself hath\nnot such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he\nwill trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will\nrather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh\nthe Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my\naqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling\ngelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,\nthen she ruminates, then she devises; and what they\nthink in their hearts they may effect, they will\nbreak their hearts but they will effect. God be\npraised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.\nI will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on\nFalstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;\nbetter three hours too soon than a minute too late.\nFie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!\nWell met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?\nAy; and as idle as she may hang together, for want\nof company. I think, if your husbands were dead,\nyou two would marry.\nWhere had you this pretty weather-cock?\nSir John Falstaff!\nIndeed she is.\nHas Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath he any\nthinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.\nWhy, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as\neasy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve\nscore. He pieces out his wife's inclination; he\ngives her folly motion and advantage: and now she's\ngoing to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A\nman may hear this shower sing in the wind. And\nFalstaff's boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;\nand our revolted wives share damnation together.\nWell; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck\nthe borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming\nMistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and\nwilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all\nmy neighbours shall cry aim.\nThe clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me\nsearch: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be\nrather praised for this than mocked; for it is as\npositive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is\nthere: I will go.\nTrust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at home;\nand I pray you all go with me.\nI beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me\nto dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have\nsport; I will show you a monster. Master doctor,\nyou shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.\nI think I shall drink in pipe wine first\nwith him; I'll make him dance. Will you go, gentles?\nPray you, come near: if I suspect without cause,\nwhy then make sport at me; then let me be your jest;\nI deserve it. How now! whither bear you this?\nBuck! I would I could wash myself of the buck!\nBuck, buck, buck! Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck;\nand of the season too, it shall appear.\nGentlemen, I have dreamed to-night; I'll tell you my\ndream. Here, here, here be my keys: ascend my\nchambers; search, seek, find out: I'll warrant\nwe'll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first.\nSo, now uncape.\nTrue, Master Page. Up, gentlemen: you shall see\nsport anon: follow me, gentlemen.\nI cannot find him: may be the knave bragged of that\nhe could not compass.\nAy, I do so.\nAmen!\nAy, ay; I must bear it.\n'Tis my fault, Master Page: I suffer for it.\nWell, I promised you a dinner. Come, come, walk in\nthe Park: I pray you, pardon me; I will hereafter\nmake known to you why I have done this. Come,\nwife; come, Mistress Page. I pray you, pardon me;\npray heartily, pardon me.\nAny thing.\nPray you, go, Master Page.\nBless you, sir!\nThat, indeed, Sir John, is my business.\nAnd sped you, sir?\nHow so, sir? Did she change her determination?\nWhat, while you were there?\nAnd did he search for you, and could not find you?\nA buck-basket!\nAnd how long lay you there?\nIn good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you\nhave sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;\nyou'll undertake her no more?\n'Tis past eight already, sir.\nHum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I\nsleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!\nthere's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.\nThis 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen\nand buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself\nwhat I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my\nhouse; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he\nshould; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,\nnor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that\nguides him should aid him, I will search\nimpossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,\nyet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:\nif I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go\nwith me: I'll be horn-mad.\nWhich way should be go? how should I bestow him?\nShall I put him into the basket again?\nAy, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any\nway then to unfool me again? Set down the basket,\nvillain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!\nO you panderly rascals! there's a knot, a ging, a\npack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil\nbe shamed. What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!\nBehold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!\nSo say I too, sir.\nCome hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford the honest\nwoman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that\nhath the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect\nwithout cause, mistress, do I?\nWell said, brazen-face! hold it out. Come forth, sirrah!\nI shall find you anon.\nEmpty the basket, I say!\nMaster Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed\nout of my house yesterday in this basket: why may\nnot he be there again? In my house I am sure he is:\nmy intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.\nPluck me out all the linen.\nWell, he's not here I seek for.\nHelp to search my house this one time. If I find\nnot what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let\nme for ever be your table-sport; let them say of\nme, 'As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow\nwalnut for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more;\nonce more search with me.\nOld woman! what old woman's that?\nA witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not\nforbid her my house? She comes of errands, does\nshe? We are simple men; we do not know what's\nbrought to pass under the profession of\nfortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells,\nby the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond\nour element we know nothing. Come down, you witch,\nyou hag, you; come down, I say!\nI'll prat her.\nOut of my door, you witch, you hag, you baggage, you\npolecat, you runyon! out, out! I'll conjure you,\nI'll fortune-tell you.\nHang her, witch!\nWill you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you, follow;\nsee but the issue of my jealousy: if I cry out thus\nupon no trail, never trust me when I open again.\nPardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;\nI rather will suspect the sun with cold\nThan thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand\nIn him that was of late an heretic,\nAs firm as faith.\nThere is no better way than that they spoke of.\nThe children must\nBe practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.\nThat will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.\nNay I'll to him again in name of Brook\nHe'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.\nWent you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me\nyou had appointed?\nNow, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,\nFalstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his\nhorns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath\nenjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his\ncudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be\npaid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for\nit, Master Brook.\nAy, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.\nWell said, fairy Hugh.\nI will never mistrust my wife again till thou art\nable to woo her in good English.\nWhat, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?\nAnd one that is as slanderous as Satan?\nAnd as wicked as his wife?\nMarry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one\nMaster Brook, that you have cozened of money, to\nwhom you should have been a pander: over and above\nthat you have suffered, I think to repay that money\nwill be a biting affliction.\nThis is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?\nStand not amazed; here is no remedy:\nIn love the heavens themselves do guide the state;\nMoney buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.\nLet it be so. Sir John,\nTo Master Brook you yet shall hold your word\nFor he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.\n", 'M'), ("Madam, you are call'd back.\nHow does your grace?\nYes, madam; but I think your grace,\nOut of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.\nWell, the voice goes, madam:\nFor after the stout Earl Northumberland\nArrested him at York, and brought him forward,\nAs a man sorely tainted, to his answer,\nHe fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill\nHe could not sit his mule.\nAt last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,\nLodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,\nWith all his covent, honourably received him;\nTo whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot,\nAn old man, broken with the storms of state,\nIs come to lay his weary bones among ye;\nGive him a little earth for charity!'\nSo went to bed; where eagerly his sickness\nPursued him still: and, three nights after this,\nAbout the hour of eight, which he himself\nForetold should be his last, full of repentance,\nContinual meditations, tears, and sorrows,\nHe gave his honours to the world again,\nHis blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.\nNoble madam,\nMen's evil manners live in brass; their virtues\nWe write in water.

Heaven witness,\nI have been to you a true and humble wife,\nAt all times to your will conformable;\nEver in fear to kindle your dislike,\nYea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry\nAs I saw it inclined: when was the hour\nI ever contradicted your desire,\nOr made it not mine too?

My next poor petition\nIs, that his noble grace would have some pity\nUpon my wretched women, that so long\nHave follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:\nOf which there is not one, I dare avow,\nAnd now I should not lie, but will deserve\nFor virtue and true beauty of the soul,\nFor honesty and decent carriage,\nA right good husband, let him be a noble\nAnd, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.\nThe last is, for my men; they are the poorest,\nBut poverty could never draw 'em from me;\nThat they may have their wages duly paid 'em,\nAnd something over to remember me by:\nIf heaven had pleased to have given me longer life\nAnd able means, we had not parted thus.\nThese are the whole contents: and, good my lord,\nBy that you love the dearest in this world,\nAs you wish Christian peace to souls departed,\nStand these poor people's friend, and urge the king\nTo do me this last right.\nI thank you, honest lord. Remember me\nIn all humility unto his highness:\nSay his long trouble now is passing\nOut of this world; tell him, in death I bless'd him,\nFor so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,\nMy lord.

Come thou near.\nDidst thou behold Octavia?\nWhere?\nIs she as tall as me?\nDidst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?\nThat's not so good: he cannot like her long.\nI think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!\nWhat majesty is in her gait? Remember,\nIf e'er thou look'dst on majesty.\nIs this certain?\nHe's very knowing;\nI do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:\nThe fellow has good judgment.\nGuess at her years, I prithee.\nWidow! Charmian, hark.\nBear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?\nFor the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.\nHer hair, what colour?\nThere's gold for thee.\nThou must not take my former sharpness ill:\nI will employ thee back again; I find thee\nMost fit for business: go make thee ready;\nOur letters are prepared.\nIndeed, he is so: I repent me much\nThat so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,\nThis creature's no such thing.\nThe man hath seen some majesty, and should know.\nI have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:\nBut 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me\nWhere I will write. All may be well enough.\nI will be even with thee, doubt it not.\nThou hast forspoke my being in these wars,\nAnd say'st it is not fit.\nIf not denounced against us, why should not we\nBe there in person?\nWhat is't you say?\nSink Rome, and their tongues rot\nThat speak against us!

O, see, my women,\nThe crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!\nO, wither'd is the garland of the war,\nThe soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls\nAre level now with men; the odds is gone,\nAnd there is nothing left remarkable\nBeneath the visiting moon.\nNo more, but e'en a woman, and commanded\nBy such poor passion as the maid that milks\nAnd does the meanest chares. It were for me\nTo throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;\nTo tell them that this world did equal theirs\nTill they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;\nPatience is scottish, and impatience does\nBecome a dog that's mad: then is it sin\nTo rush into the secret house of death,\nEre death dare come to us?

Good sirs, take heart:\nWe'll bury him; and then, what's brave,\nwhat's noble,\nLet's do it after the high Roman fashion,\nAnd make death proud to take us. Come, away:\nThis case of that huge spirit now is cold:\nAh, women, women! come; we have no friend\nBut resolution, and the briefest end.\nMy desolation does begin to make\nA better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;\nNot being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,\nA minister of her will: and it is great\nTo do that thing that ends all other deeds;\nWhich shackles accidents and bolts up change;\nWhich sleeps, and never palates more the dug,\nThe beggar's nurse and Caesar's.\nWhat's thy name?\nAntony\nDid tell me of you, bade me trust you; but\nI do not greatly care to be deceived,\nThat have no use for trusting. If your master\nWould have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,\nThat majesty, to keep decorum, must\nNo less beg than a kingdom: if he please\nTo give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,\nHe gives me so much of mine own, as I\nWill kneel to him with thanks.\nPray you, tell him\nI am his fortune's vassal, and I send him\nThe greatness he has got. I hourly learn\nA doctrine of obedience; and would gladly\nLook him i' the face.\nQuick, quick, good hands.\nWhat, of death too,\nThat rids our dogs of languish?\nWhere art thou, death?\nCome hither, come! come, come, and take a queen\nWorthy many babes and beggars!\nSir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;\nIf idle talk will once be necessary,\nI'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,\nDo Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I\nWill not wait pinion'd at your master's court;\nNor once be chastised with the sober eye\nOf dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up\nAnd show me to the shouting varletry\nOf censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt\nBe gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud\nLay me stark naked, and let the water-flies\nBlow me into abhorring! rather make\nMy country's high pyramides my gibbet,\nAnd hang me up in chains!\nSay, I would die.\nI cannot tell.\nNo matter, sir, what I have heard or known.\nYou laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;\nIs't not your trick?\nI dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:\nO, such another sleep, that I might see\nBut such another man!\nHis face was as the heavens; and therein stuck\nA sun and moon, which kept their course,\nand lighted\nThe little O, the earth.\nHis legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm\nCrested the world: his voice was propertied\nAs all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;\nBut when he meant to quail and shake the orb,\nHe was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,\nThere was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas\nThat grew the more by reaping: his delights\nWere dolphin-like; they show'd his back above\nThe element they lived in: in his livery\nWalk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were\nAs plates dropp'd from his pocket.\nThink you there was, or might be, such a man\nAs this I dream'd of?\nYou lie, up to the hearing of the gods.\nBut, if there be, or ever were, one such,\nIt's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff\nTo vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine\nAnd Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,\nCondemning shadows quite.\nI thank you, sir,\nKnow you what Caesar means to do with me?\nNay, pray you, sir,\xe2\x80\x94\nHe'll lead me, then, in triumph?\nSir, the gods\nWill have it thus; my master and my lord\nI must obey.\nSole sir o' the world,\nI cannot project mine own cause so well\nTo make it clear; but do confess I have\nBeen laden with like frailties which before\nHave often shamed our sex.\nAnd may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,\nYour scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall\nHang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.\nThis is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,\nI am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;\nNot petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?\nThis is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,\nUpon his peril, that I have reserved\nTo myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.\nWhat have I kept back?\nSee, Caesar! O, behold,\nHow pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;\nAnd, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.\nThe ingratitude of this Seleucus does\nEven make me wild: O slave, of no more trust\nThan love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt\nGo back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,\nThough they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!\nO rarely base!\nO Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,\nThat thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,\nDoing the honour of thy lordliness\nTo one so meek, that mine own servant should\nParcel the sum of my disgraces by\nAddition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,\nThat I some lady trifles have reserved,\nImmoment toys, things of such dignity\nAs we greet modern friends withal; and say,\nSome nobler token I have kept apart\nFor Livia and Octavia, to induce\nTheir mediation; must I be unfolded\nWith one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me\nBeneath the fall I have.\nPrithee, go hence;\nOr I shall show the cinders of my spirits\nThrough the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,\nThou wouldst have mercy on me.\nBe it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought\nFor things that others do; and, when we fall,\nWe answer others' merits in our name,\nAre therefore to be pitied.\nMy master, and my lord!\nHe words me, girls, he words me, that I should not\nBe noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.\nHie thee again:\nI have spoke already, and it is provided;\nGo put it to the haste.\nDolabella!\nDolabella,\nI shall remain your debtor.\nFarewell, and thanks.\nNow, Iras, what think'st thou?\nThou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown\nIn Rome, as well as I. mechanic slaves\nWith greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall\nUplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,\nRank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,\nAnd forced to drink their vapour.\nNay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors\nWill catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers\nBallad us out o' tune: the quick comedians\nExtemporally will stage us, and present\nOur Alexandrian revels; Antony\nShall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see\nSome squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness\nI' the posture of a whore.\nNay, that's certain.\nWhy, that's the way\nTo fool their preparation, and to conquer\nTheir most absurd intents.\nNow, Charmian!\nShow me, my women, like a queen: go fetch\nMy best attires: I am again for Cydnus,\nTo meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.\nNow, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;\nAnd, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave\nTo play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.\nWherefore's this noise?\nLet him come in.\nWhat poor an instrument\nMay do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.\nMy resolution's placed, and I have nothing\nOf woman in me: now from head to foot\nI am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon\nNo planet is of mine.\nAvoid, and leave him.\nHast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,\nThat kills and pains not?\nRememberest thou any that have died on't?\nGet thee hence; farewell.\nFarewell.\nAy, ay; farewell.\nTake thou no care; it shall be heeded.\nWill it eat me?\nWell, get thee gone; farewell.\nGive me my robe, put on my crown; I have\nImmortal longings in me: now no more\nThe juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:\nYare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear\nAntony call; I see him rouse himself\nTo praise my noble act; I hear him mock\nThe luck of Caesar, which the gods give men\nTo excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:\nNow to that name my courage prove my title!\nI am fire and air; my other elements\nI give to baser life. So; have you done?\nCome then, and take the last warmth of my lips.\nFarewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.\nHave I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?\nIf thou and nature can so gently part,\nThe stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,\nWhich hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?\nIf thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world\nIt is not worth leave-taking.\nThis proves me base:\nIf she first meet the curled Antony,\nHe'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss\nWhich is my heaven to have. Come, thou\nmortal wretch,\nWith thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate\nOf life at once untie: poor venomous fool\nBe angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,\nThat I might hear thee call great Caesar ass\nUnpolicied!\nPeace, peace!\nDost thou not see my baby at my breast,\nThat sucks the nurse asleep?\nAs sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,\xe2\x80\x94\nO Antony!\xe2\x80\x94Nay, I will take thee too.\nWhat should I stay\xe2\x80\x94\n", 'F'), ("Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;\nDearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;\nBeyond what can be valued, rich or rare;\nNo less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;\nAs much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;\nA love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.\nBeyond all manner of so much I love you.\nPrescribe not us our duties.\nSister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly\nappertains to us both. I think our father will hence to-night.\nYou see how full of changes his age is. The observation we\nhave made of it hath not been little.

Sir, will you hear my suit?\nThanks, sir; all the rest is mute.\nThe honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,\nBefore I speak, too threateningly replies:\nLove make your fortunes twenty times above\nHer that so wishes and her humble love!\nMy wish receive,\nWhich great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.\nBe not afraid that I your hand should take;\nI'll never do you wrong for your own sake:\nBlessing upon your vows! and in your bed\nFind fairer fortune, if you ever wed!\nYou are too young, too happy, and too good,\nTo make yourself a son out of my blood.\nI dare not say I take you; but I give\nMe and my service, ever whilst I live,\nInto your guiding power. This is the man.\nThat you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:\nLet the rest go.\nMy mother greets me kindly; is she well?\nIf she be very well, what does she ail, that she's\nnot very well?\nWhat two things?\nI hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own\ngood fortunes.\nWhat's his will else?\nWhat more commands he?\nIn every thing I wait upon his will.\nI pray you.\nCome, sirrah.\nI have, sir, as I was commanded from you,\nSpoke with the king and have procured his leave\nFor present parting; only he desires\nSome private speech with you.\nSir, I can nothing say,\nBut that I am your most obedient servant.\nAnd ever shall\nWith true observance seek to eke out that\nWherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd\nTo equal my great fortune.\nPray, sir, your pardon.\nI am not worthy of the wealth I owe,\nNor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;\nBut, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal\nWhat law does vouch mine own.\nSomething; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.\nI would not tell you what I would, my lord:\nFaith yes;\nStrangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.\nI shall not break your bidding, good my lord.\nMadam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.\nLook on his letter, madam; here's my passport.\nWhen thou canst get the ring upon my finger which\nnever shall come off, and show me a child begotten\nof thy body that I am father to, then call me\nhusband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'\nThis is a dreadful sentence.\nTill I have no wife I have nothing in France.\n'Tis bitter.\nAy, madam.\n'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'\nNothing in France, until he has no wife!\nThou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;\nThen hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I\nThat chase thee from thy country and expose\nThose tender limbs of thine to the event\nOf the none-sparing war? and is it I\nThat drive thee from the sportive court, where thou\nWast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark\nOf smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,\nThat ride upon the violent speed of fire,\nFly with false aim; move the still-peering air,\nThat sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.\nWhoever shoots at him, I set him there;\nWhoever charges on his forward breast,\nI am the caitiff that do hold him to't;\nAnd, though I kill him not, I am the cause\nHis death was so effected: better 'twere\nI met the ravin lion when he roar'd\nWith sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere\nThat all the miseries which nature owes\nWere mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,\nWhence honour but of danger wins a scar,\nAs oft it loses all: I will be gone;\nMy being here it is that holds thee hence:\nShall I stay here to do't? no, no, although\nThe air of paradise did fan the house\nAnd angels officed all: I will be gone,\nThat pitiful rumour may report my flight,\nTo consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!\nFor with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.\nTo Saint Jaques le Grand.\nWhere do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?\nIs this the way?\nIs it yourself?\nI thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.\nI did so.\nHis name, I pray you.\nBut by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:\nHis face I know not.\nAy, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.\nWhat's his name?\nO, I believe with him,\nIn argument of praise, or to the worth\nOf the great count himself, she is too mean\nTo have her name repeated: all her deserving\nIs a reserved honesty, and that\nI have not heard examined.\nHow do you mean?\nMay be the amorous count solicits her\nIn the unlawful purpose.\nWhich is the Frenchman?\nI like him well.\nWhich is he?\nPerchance he's hurt i' the battle.\nI humbly thank you:\nPlease it this matron and this gentle maid\nTo eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking\nShall be for me; and, to requite you further,\nI will bestow some precepts of this virgin\nWorthy the note.\nIf you misdoubt me that I am not she,\nI know not how I shall assure you further,\nBut I shall lose the grounds I work upon.\nNor would I wish you.\nFirst, give me trust, the count he is my husband,\nAnd what to your sworn counsel I have spoken\nIs so from word to word; and then you cannot,\nBy the good aid that I of you shall borrow,\nErr in bestowing it.\nTake this purse of gold,\nAnd let me buy your friendly help thus far,\nWhich I will over-pay and pay again\nWhen I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,\nLays down his wanton siege before her beauty,\nResolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,\nAs we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.\nNow his important blood will nought deny\nThat she'll demand: a ring the county wears,\nThat downward hath succeeded in his house\nFrom son to son, some four or five descents\nSince the first father wore it: this ring he holds\nIn most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,\nTo buy his will, it would not seem too dear,\nHowe'er repented after.\nYou see it lawful, then: it is no more,\nBut that your daughter, ere she seems as won,\nDesires this ring; appoints him an encounter;\nIn fine, delivers me to fill the time,\nHerself most chastely absent: after this,\nTo marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns\nTo what is passed already.\nWhy then to-night\nLet us assay our plot; which, if it speed,\nIs wicked meaning in a lawful deed\nAnd lawful meaning in a lawful act,\nWhere both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:\nBut let's about it.\nThat you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,\nOne of the greatest in the Christian world\nShall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,\nEre I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:\nTime was, I did him a desired office,\nDear almost as his life; which gratitude\nThrough flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,\nAnd answer, thanks: I duly am inform'd\nHis grace is at Marseilles; to which place\nWe have convenient convoy. You must know\nI am supposed dead: the army breaking,\nMy husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,\nAnd by the leave of my good lord the king,\nWe'll be before our welcome.\nNor you, mistress,\nEver a friend whose thoughts more truly labour\nTo recompense your love: doubt not but heaven\nHath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,\nAs it hath fated her to be my motive\nAnd helper to a husband. But, O strange men!\nThat can such sweet use make of what they hate,\nWhen saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts\nDefiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play\nWith what it loathes for that which is away.\nBut more of this hereafter. You, Diana,\nUnder my poor instructions yet must suffer\nSomething in my behalf.\nYet, I pray you:\nBut with the word the time will bring on summer,\nWhen briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,\nAnd be as sweet as sharp. We must away;\nOur wagon is prepared, and time revives us:\nAll's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;\nWhate'er the course, the end is the renown.\nBut this exceeding posting day and night\nMust wear your spirits low; we cannot help it:\nBut since you have made the days and nights as one,\nTo wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,\nBe bold you do so grow in my requital\nAs nothing can unroot you. In happy time;\nThis man may help me to his majesty's ear,\nIf he would spend his power. God save you, sir.\nSir, I have seen you in the court of France.\nI do presume, sir, that you are not fallen\nFrom the report that goes upon your goodness;\nAn therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,\nWhich lay nice manners by, I put you to\nThe use of your own virtues, for the which\nI shall continue thankful.\nThat it will please you\nTo give this poor petition to the king,\nAnd aid me with that store of power you have\nTo come into his presence.\nNot here, sir!\nALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL yet,\nThough time seem so adverse and means unfit.\nI do beseech you, whither is he gone?\nI do beseech you, sir,\nSince you are like to see the king before me,\nCommend the paper to his gracious hand,\nWhich I presume shall render you no blame\nBut rather make you thank your pains for it.\nI will come after you with what good speed\nOur means will make us means.\nAnd you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,\nWhate'er falls more. We must to horse again.\nGo, go, provide.\nNo, my good lord;\n'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,\nThe name and not the thing.\nO my good lord, when I was like this maid,\nI found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;\nAnd, look you, here's your letter; this it says:\n'When from my finger you can get this ring\nAnd are by me with child,' &c.

Long stay'd he so.\nAt last, a little shaking of mine arm,\nAnd thrice his head thus waving up and down,\nHe rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound\nAs it did seem to shatter all his bulk\nAnd end his being. That done, he lets me go,\nAnd with his head over his shoulder turn'd\nHe seem'd to find his way without his eyes,\nFor out o' doors he went without their help\nAnd to the last bended their light on me.\nNo, my good lord; but, as you did command,\nI did repel his letters and denied\nHis access to me.\nMadam, I wish it may.\nGood my lord,\nHow does your honour for this many a day?\nMy lord, I have remembrances of yours\nThat I have longed long to re-deliver.\nI pray you, now receive them.\nMy honour'd lord, you know right well you did,\nAnd with them words of so sweet breath compos'd\nAs made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,\nTake these again; for to the noble mind\nRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.\nThere, my lord.\nMy lord?\nWhat means your lordship?\nCould beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?\nIndeed, my lord, you made me believe so.\nI was the more deceived.\nAt home, my lord.\nO, help him, you sweet heavens!\nO heavenly powers, restore him!\nO, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!\nThe courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,\nTh' expectancy and rose of the fair state,\nThe glass of fashion and the mould of form,\nTh' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!\nAnd I, of ladies most deject and wretched,\nThat suck'd the honey of his music vows,\nNow see that noble and most sovereign reason,\nLike sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;\nThat unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth\nBlasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me\nT' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!\nNo, my lord.\nAy, my lord.\nI think nothing, my lord.\nWhat is, my lord?\nYou are merry, my lord.\nAy, my lord.\nNay 'tis twice two months, my lord.\nWhat means this, my lord?\nBelike this show imports the argument of the play.\nWill he tell us what this show meant?\nYou are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.\nPro. For us, and for our tragedy,\nHere stooping to your clemency,\nWe beg your hearing patiently.\n'Tis brief, my lord.\nYou are as good as a chorus, my lord.\nYou are keen, my lord, you are keen.\nStill better, and worse.\nThe King rises.\nWhere is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?\nHow should I your true-love know\nFrom another one?\nBy his cockle bat and' staff\nAnd his sandal shoon.\nSay you? Nay, pray You mark.\nHe is dead and gone, lady,\nHe is dead and gone;\nAt his head a grass-green turf,\nAt his heels a stone.\nO, ho!\nPray you mark.\nWhite his shroud as the mountain snow-\nLarded all with sweet flowers;\nWhich bewept to the grave did not go\nWith true-love showers.\nWell, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.\nLord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at\nyour table!\nPray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you what\nit means, say you this:\nTo-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,\nAll in the morning bedtime,\nAnd I a maid at your window,\nTo be your Valentine.\nThen up he rose and donn'd his clo'es\nAnd dupp'd the chamber door,\nLet in the maid, that out a maid\nNever departed more.\nIndeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!\nBy Gis and by Saint Charity,\nAlack, and fie for shame!\nYoung men will do't if they come to't\nBy Cock, they are to blame.\nQuoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,\nYou promis'd me to wed.'\nHe answers:\n'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,\nAn thou hadst not come to my bed.'\nI hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot\nchoose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold ground.\nMy brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good\ncounsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night, sweet\nladies. Good night, good night. \nThey bore him barefac'd on the bier\n(Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)\nAnd in his grave rain'd many a tear.\nFare you well, my dove!\nYou must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,\nhow the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his\nmaster's daughter.\nThere's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,\nremember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.\nThere's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,\nand here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays.\nO, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I\nwould give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my father\ndied. They say he made a good end.\nFor bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.\nAnd will he not come again?\nAnd will he not come again?\nNo, no, he is dead;\nGo to thy deathbed;\nHe never will come again.\nHis beard was as white as snow,\nAll flaxen was his poll.\nHe is gone, he is gone,\nAnd we cast away moan.\nGod 'a'mercy on his soul!\nAnd of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.\n", 'F')]
