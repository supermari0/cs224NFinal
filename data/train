[("Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour\nDraws on apace; four happy days bring in\nAnother moon: but, O, methinks, how slow\nThis old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,\nLike to a step-dame or a dowager\nLong withering out a young man revenue.\nGo, Philostrate,\nStir up the Athenian youth to merriments;\nAwake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;\nTurn melancholy forth to funerals;\nThe pale companion is not for our pomp.\nHippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,\nAnd won thy love, doing thee injuries;\nBut I will wed thee in another key,\nWith pomp, with triumph and with revelling.\nThanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?\nWhat say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:\nTo you your father should be as a god;\nOne that composed your beauties, yea, and one\nTo whom you are but as a form in wax\nBy him imprinted and within his power\nTo leave the figure or disfigure it.\nDemetrius is a worthy gentleman.\nIn himself he is;\nBut in this kind, wanting your father's voice,\nThe other must be held the worthier.\nRather your eyes must with his judgment look.\nEither to die the death or to abjure\nFor ever the society of men.\nTherefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;\nKnow of your youth, examine well your blood,\nWhether, if you yield not to your father's choice,\nYou can endure the livery of a nun,\nFor aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,\nTo live a barren sister all your life,\nChanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.\nThrice-blessed they that master so their blood,\nTo undergo such maiden pilgrimage;\nBut earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,\nThan that which withering on the virgin thorn\nGrows, lives and dies in single blessedness.\nTake time to pause; and, by the nest new moon\xe2\x80\x94\nThe sealing-day betwixt my love and me,\nFor everlasting bond of fellowship\xe2\x80\x94\nUpon that day either prepare to die\nFor disobedience to your father's will,\nOr else to wed Demetrius, as he would;\nOr on Diana's altar to protest\nFor aye austerity and single life.\nI must confess that I have heard so much,\nAnd with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;\nBut, being over-full of self-affairs,\nMy mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;\nAnd come, Egeus; you shall go with me,\nI have some private schooling for you both.\nFor you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself\nTo fit your fancies to your father's will;\nOr else the law of Athens yields you up\xe2\x80\x94\nWhich by no means we may extenuate\xe2\x80\x94\nTo death, or to a vow of single life.\nCome, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?\nDemetrius and Egeus, go along:\nI must employ you in some business\nAgainst our nuptial and confer with you\nOf something nearly that concerns yourselves.\nGo, one of you, find out the forester;\nFor now our observation is perform'd;\nAnd since we have the vaward of the day,\nMy love shall hear the music of my hounds.\nUncouple in the western valley; let them go:\nDispatch, I say, and find the forester.\nWe will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,\nAnd mark the musical confusion\nOf hounds and echo in conjunction.\nMy hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,\nSo flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung\nWith ears that sweep away the morning dew;\nCrook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;\nSlow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,\nEach under each. A cry more tuneable\nWas never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,\nIn Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:\nJudge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?\nNo doubt they rose up early to observe\nThe rite of May, and hearing our intent,\nCame here in grace our solemnity.\nBut speak, Egeus; is not this the day\nThat Hermia should give answer of her choice?\nGo, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.\nGood morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:\nBegin these wood-birds but to couple now?\nI pray you all, stand up.\nI know you two are rival enemies:\nHow comes this gentle concord in the world,\nThat hatred is so far from jealousy,\nTo sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?\nFair lovers, you are fortunately met:\nOf this discourse we more will hear anon.\nEgeus, I will overbear your will;\nFor in the temple by and by with us\nThese couples shall eternally be knit:\nAnd, for the morning now is something worn,\nOur purposed hunting shall be set aside.\nAway with us to Athens; three and three,\nWe'll hold a feast in great solemnity.\nCome, Hippolyta.\nMore strange than true: I never may believe\nThese antique fables, nor these fairy toys.\nLovers and madmen have such seething brains,\nSuch shaping fantasies, that apprehend\nMore than cool reason ever comprehends.\nThe lunatic, the lover and the poet\nAre of imagination all compact:\nOne sees more devils than vast hell can hold,\nThat is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,\nSees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:\nThe poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,\nDoth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;\nAnd as imagination bodies forth\nThe forms of things unknown, the poet's pen\nTurns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing\nA local habitation and a name.\nSuch tricks hath strong imagination,\nThat if it would but apprehend some joy,\nIt comprehends some bringer of that joy;\nOr in the night, imagining some fear,\nHow easy is a bush supposed a bear!\nHere come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.\nJoy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love\nAccompany your hearts!\nCome now; what masques, what dances shall we have,\nTo wear away this long age of three hours\nBetween our after-supper and bed-time?\nWhere is our usual manager of mirth?\nWhat revels are in hand? Is there no play,\nTo ease the anguish of a torturing hour?\nCall Philostrate.\nSay, what abridgement have you for this evening?\nWhat masque? what music? How shall we beguile\nThe lazy time, if not with some delight?\n'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung\nBy an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'\nWe'll none of that: that have I told my love,\nIn glory of my kinsman Hercules.\n'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,\nTearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'\nThat is an old device; and it was play'd\nWhen I from Thebes came last a conqueror.\n'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death\nOf Learning, late deceased in beggary.'\nThat is some satire, keen and critical,\nNot sorting with a nuptial ceremony.\n'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus\nAnd his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'\nMerry and tragical! tedious and brief!\nThat is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.\nHow shall we find the concord of this discord?\nWhat are they that do play it?\nAnd we will hear it.\nI will hear that play;\nFor never anything can be amiss,\nWhen simpleness and duty tender it.\nGo, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.\nWhy, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.\nThe kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.\nOur sport shall be to take what they mistake:\nAnd what poor duty cannot do, noble respect\nTakes it in might, not merit.\nWhere I have come, great clerks have purposed\nTo greet me with premeditated welcomes;\nWhere I have seen them shiver and look pale,\nMake periods in the midst of sentences,\nThrottle their practised accent in their fears\nAnd in conclusion dumbly have broke off,\nNot paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,\nOut of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;\nAnd in the modesty of fearful duty\nI read as much as from the rattling tongue\nOf saucy and audacious eloquence.\nLove, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity\nIn least speak most, to my capacity.\nLet him approach.\nThis fellow doth not stand upon points.\nHis speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing\nimpaired, but all disordered. Who is next?\nI wonder if the lion be to speak.\nWould you desire lime and hair to speak better?\nPyramus draws near the wall: silence!\nThe wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.\nNow is the mural down between the two neighbours.\nThe best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst\nare no worse, if imagination amend them.\nIf we imagine no worse of them than they of\nthemselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here\ncome two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.\nA very gentle beast, of a good conscience.\nTrue; and a goose for his discretion.\nHis discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;\nfor the goose carries not the fox. It is well:\nleave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.\nHe is no crescent, and his horns are\ninvisible within the circumference.\nThis is the greatest error of all the rest: the man\nshould be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the\nman i' the moon?\nIt appears, by his small light of discretion, that\nhe is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all\nreason, we must stay the time.\nWell run, Thisbe.\nWell moused, Lion.\nThis passion, and the death of a dear friend, would\ngo near to make a man look sad.\nWith the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and\nprove an ass.\nShe will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and\nher passion ends the play.\nMoonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.\nNo epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no\nexcuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all\ndead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he\nthat writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself\nin Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine\ntragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably\ndischarged. But come, your Bergomask: let your\nepilogue alone.\nThe iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:\nLovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.\nI fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn\nAs much as we this night have overwatch'd.\nThis palpable-gross play hath well beguiled\nThe heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.\nA fortnight hold we this solemnity,\nIn nightly revels and new jollity.\n", 'M'), ("What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\nMy sword, I say! Old Montague is come,\nAnd flourishes his blade in spite of me.\nBut Montague is bound as well as I,\nIn penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,\nFor men so old as we to keep the peace.\nBut saying o'er what I have said before:\nMy child is yet a stranger in the world;\nShe hath not seen the change of fourteen years,\nLet two more summers wither in their pride,\nEre we may think her ripe to be a bride.\nAnd too soon marr'd are those so early made.\nThe earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,\nShe is the hopeful lady of my earth:\nBut woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,\nMy will to her consent is but a part;\nAn she agree, within her scope of choice\nLies my consent and fair according voice.\nThis night I hold an old accustom'd feast,\nWhereto I have invited many a guest,\nSuch as I love; and you, among the store,\nOne more, most welcome, makes my number more.\nAt my poor house look to behold this night\nEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:\nSuch comfort as do lusty young men feel\nWhen well-apparell'd April on the heel\nOf limping winter treads, even such delight\nAmong fresh female buds shall you this night\nInherit at my house; hear all, all see,\nAnd like her most whose merit most shall be:\nWhich on more view, of many mine being one\nMay stand in number, though in reckoning none,\nCome, go with me.\nGo, sirrah, trudge about\nThrough fair Verona; find those persons out\nWhose names are written there, and to them say,\nMy house and welcome on their pleasure stay.\nWelcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes\nUnplagued with corns will have a bout with you.\nAh ha, my mistresses! which of you all\nWill now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,\nShe, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?\nWelcome, gentlemen!

In one little body\nThou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;\nFor still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,\nDo ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,\nSailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;\nWho, raging with thy tears, and they with them,\nWithout a sudden calm, will overset\nThy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!\nHave you deliver'd to her our decree?\nSoft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.\nHow! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?\nIs she not proud? doth she not count her blest,\nUnworthy as she is, that we have wrought\nSo worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?\nHow now, how now, chop-logic!

There she lies,\nFlower as she was, deflowered by him.\nDeath is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;\nMy daughter he hath wedded: I will die,\nAnd leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.\nDespised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!\nUncomfortable time, why camest thou now\nTo murder, murder our solemnity?\nO child! O child! my soul, and not my child!\nDead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;\nAnd with my child my joys are buried.\nAll things that we ordained festival,\nTurn from their office to black funeral;\nOur instruments to melancholy bells,\nOur wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,\nOur solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,\nOur bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,\nAnd all things change them to the contrary.\nWhat should it be, that they so shriek abroad?\nO heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\nThis dagger hath mista'en\xe2\x80\x94for, lo, his house\nIs empty on the back of Montague,\xe2\x80\x94\nAnd it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand:\nThis is my daughter's jointure, for no more\nCan I demand.\nAs rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity!\n", 'M'), ("Always obedient to your grace's will,\nI come to know your pleasure.\nNow, good my lord,\nLet there be some more test made of my metal,\nBefore so noble and so great a figure\nBe stamp'd upon it.\nYet give leave, my lord,\nThat we may bring you something on the way.\nThe heavens give safety to your purposes!\n'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,\nAnd we may soon our satisfaction have\nTouching that point.\nWe must not make a scarecrow of the law,\nSetting it up to fear the birds of prey,\nAnd let it keep one shape, till custom make it\nTheir perch and not their terror.\n'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,\nAnother thing to fall. I not deny,\nThe jury, passing on the prisoner's life,\nMay in the sworn twelve have a thief or two\nGuiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,\nThat justice seizes: what know the laws\nThat thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,\nThe jewel that we find, we stoop and take't\nBecause we see it; but what we do not see\nWe tread upon, and never think of it.\nYou may not so extenuate his offence\nFor I have had such faults; but rather tell me,\nWhen I, that censure him, do so offend,\nLet mine own judgment pattern out my death,\nAnd nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.\nWhere is the provost?\nSee that Claudio\nBe executed by nine to-morrow morning:\nBring him his confessor, let him be prepared;\nFor that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.\nHow now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?\nBenefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are\nthey not malefactors?\nGo to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your\nname? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?\nWhat are you, sir?\nThis will last out a night in Russia,\nWhen nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.\nAnd leave you to the hearing of the cause;\nHoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.\nNow, what's the matter. Provost?\nDid not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?\nWhy dost thou ask again?\nGo to; let that be mine:\nDo you your office, or give up your place,\nAnd you shall well be spared.\nDispose of her\nTo some more fitter place, and that with speed.\nHath he a sister?\nWell, let her be admitted.\nSee you the fornicatress be removed:\nLet have needful, but not lavish, means;\nThere shall be order for't.\nStay a little while.\nYou're welcome: what's your will?\nWell; what's your suit?\nWell; the matter?\nCondemn the fault and not the actor of it?\nWhy, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:\nMine were the very cipher of a function,\nTo fine the faults whose fine stands in record,\nAnd let go by the actor.\nMaiden, no remedy.\nI will not do't.\nLook, what I will not, that I cannot do.\nHe's sentenced; 'tis too late.\nPray you, be gone.\nYour brother is a forfeit of the law,\nAnd you but waste your words.\nBe you content, fair maid;\nIt is the law, not I condemn your brother:\nWere he my kinsman, brother, or my son,\nIt should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.\nThe law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:\nThose many had not dared to do that evil,\nIf the first that did the edict infringe\nHad answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake\nTakes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,\nLooks in a glass, that shows what future evils,\nEither new, or by remissness new-conceived,\nAnd so in progress to be hatch'd and born,\nAre now to have no successive degrees,\nBut, ere they live, to end.\nI show it most of all when I show justice;\nFor then I pity those I do not know,\nWhich a dismiss'd offence would after gall;\nAnd do him right that, answering one foul wrong,\nLives not to act another. Be satisfied;\nYour brother dies to-morrow; be content.\nWhy do you put these sayings upon me?\nShe speaks, and 'tis\nSuch sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.\nI will bethink me: come again tomorrow.\nHow! bribe me?\nWell; come to me to-morrow.\nAmen:\nFor I am that way going to temptation,\nWhere prayers cross.\nAt any time 'fore noon.\nFrom thee, even from thy virtue!\nWhat's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?\nThe tempter or the tempted, who sins most?\nHa!\nNot she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I\nThat, lying by the violet in the sun,\nDo as the carrion does, not as the flower,\nCorrupt with virtuous season. Can it be\nThat modesty may more betray our sense\nThan woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,\nShall we desire to raze the sanctuary\nAnd pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!\nWhat dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?\nDost thou desire her foully for those things\nThat make her good? O, let her brother live!\nThieves for their robbery have authority\nWhen judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,\nThat I desire to hear her speak again,\nAnd feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?\nO cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,\nWith saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous\nIs that temptation that doth goad us on\nTo sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,\nWith all her double vigour, art and nature,\nOnce stir my temper; but this virtuous maid\nSubdues me quite. Even till now,\nWhen men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.\nWhen I would pray and think, I think and pray\nTo several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;\nWhilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,\nAnchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,\nAs if I did but only chew his name;\nAnd in my heart the strong and swelling evil\nOf my conception. The state, whereon I studied\nIs like a good thing, being often read,\nGrown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,\nWherein\xe2\x80\x94let no man hear me\xe2\x80\x94I take pride,\nCould I with boot change for an idle plume,\nWhich the air beats for vain. O place, O form,\nHow often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,\nWrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls\nTo thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:\nLet's write good angel on the devil's horn:\n'Tis not the devil's crest.\nHow now! who's there?\nTeach her the way.\nO heavens!\nWhy does my blood thus muster to my heart,\nMaking both it unable for itself,\nAnd dispossessing all my other parts\nOf necessary fitness?\nSo play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;\nCome all to help him, and so stop the air\nBy which he should revive: and even so\nThe general, subject to a well-wish'd king,\nQuit their own part, and in obsequious fondness\nCrowd to his presence, where their untaught love\nMust needs appear offence.\nHow now, fair maid?\nThat you might know it, would much better please me\nThan to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.\nYet may he live awhile; and, it may be,\nAs long as you or I. yet he must die.\nYea.\nHa! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good\nTo pardon him that hath from nature stolen\nA man already made, as to remit\nTheir saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image\nIn stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy\nFalsely to take away a life true made\nAs to put metal in restrained means\nTo make a false one.\nSay you so? then I shall pose you quickly.\nWhich had you rather, that the most just law\nNow took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,\nGive up your body to such sweet uncleanness\nAs she that he hath stain'd?\nI talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins\nStand more for number than for accompt.\nNay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak\nAgainst the thing I say. Answer to this:\nI, now the voice of the recorded law,\nPronounce a sentence on your brother's life:\nMight there not be a charity in sin\nTo save this brother's life?\nPleased you to do't at peril of your soul,\nWere equal poise of sin and charity.\nNay, but hear me.\nYour sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,\nOr seem so craftily; and that's not good.\nThus wisdom wishes to appear most bright\nWhen it doth tax itself; as these black masks\nProclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder\nThan beauty could, display'd. But mark me;\nTo be received plain, I'll speak more gross:\nYour brother is to die.\nAnd his offence is so, as it appears,\nAccountant to the law upon that pain.\nAdmit no other way to save his life,\xe2\x80\x94\nAs I subscribe not that, nor any other,\nBut in the loss of question,\xe2\x80\x94that you, his sister,\nFinding yourself desired of such a person,\nWhose credit with the judge, or own great place,\nCould fetch your brother from the manacles\nOf the all-building law; and that there were\nNo earthly mean to save him, but that either\nYou must lay down the treasures of your body\nTo this supposed, or else to let him suffer;\nWhat would you do?\nThen must your brother die.\nWere not you then as cruel as the sentence\nThat you have slander'd so?\nYou seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;\nAnd rather proved the sliding of your brother\nA merriment than a vice.\nWe are all frail.\nNay, women are frail too.\nI think it well:\nAnd from this testimony of your own sex,\xe2\x80\x94\nSince I suppose we are made to be no stronger\nThan faults may shake our frames,\xe2\x80\x94let me be bold;\nI do arrest your words. Be that you are,\nThat is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;\nIf you be one, as you are well express'd\nBy all external warrants, show it now,\nBy putting on the destined livery.\nPlainly conceive, I love you.\nHe shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.\nBelieve me, on mine honour,\nMy words express my purpose.\nWho will believe thee, Isabel?\nMy unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,\nMy vouch against you, and my place i' the state,\nWill so your accusation overweigh,\nThat you shall stifle in your own report\nAnd smell of calumny. I have begun,\nAnd now I give my sensual race the rein:\nFit thy consent to my sharp appetite;\nLay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,\nThat banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother\nBy yielding up thy body to my will;\nOr else he must not only die the death,\nBut thy unkindness shall his death draw out\nTo lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,\nOr, by the affection that now guides me most,\nI'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,\nSay what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.\nIn most uneven and distracted manner. His actions\nshow much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be\nnot tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and\nredeliver our authorities there\nAnd why should we proclaim it in an hour before his\nentering, that if any crave redress of injustice,\nthey should exhibit their petitions in the street?\nWell, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes\ni' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give\nnotice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet\nhim.\nGood night.\nThis deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant\nAnd dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!\nAnd by an eminent body that enforced\nThe law against it! But that her tender shame\nWill not proclaim against her maiden loss,\nHow might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;\nFor my authority bears of a credent bulk,\nThat no particular scandal once can touch\nBut it confounds the breather. He should have lived,\nSave that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,\nMight in the times to come have ta'en revenge,\nBy so receiving a dishonour'd life\nWith ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!\nA lack, when once our grace we have forgot,\nNothing goes right: we would, and we would not.\nHappy return be to your royal grace!\nYou make my bonds still greater.\nMy lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:\nShe hath been a suitor to me for her brother\nCut off by course of justice,\xe2\x80\x94\nAnd she will speak most bitterly and strange.\nCharges she more than me?\nThis is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.\nMy lord, I must confess I know this woman:\nAnd five years since there was some speech of marriage\nBetwixt myself and her; which was broke off,\nPartly for that her promised proportions\nCame short of composition, but in chief\nFor that her reputation was disvalued\nIn levity: since which time of five years\nI never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,\nUpon my faith and honour.\nI did but smile till now:\nNow, good my lord, give me the scope of justice\nMy patience here is touch'd. I do perceive\nThese poor informal women are no more\nBut instruments of some more mightier member\nThat sets them on: let me have way, my lord,\nTo find this practise out.\nWhat can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?\nIs this the man that you did tell us of?\nHark, how the villain would close now, after his\ntreasonable abuses!\nWhat, resists he? Help him, Lucio.\nO my dread lord,\nI should be guiltier than my guiltiness,\nTo think I can be undiscernible,\nWhen I perceive your grace, like power divine,. Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,\nNo longer session hold upon my shame,\nBut let my trial be mine own confession:\nImmediate sentence then and sequent death\nIs all the grace I beg.\nI was, my lord.\nI am sorry that such sorrow I procure:\nAnd so deep sticks it in my penitent heart\nThat I crave death more willingly than mercy;\n'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.\n", 'M'), ("What a haste looks through his eyes!

No, come thou home, Rousillon,\nWhence honour but of danger wins a scar,\nAs oft it loses all: I will be gone;\nMy being here it is that holds thee hence:\nShall I stay here to do't? no, no, although\nThe air of paradise did fan the house\nAnd angels officed all: I will be gone,\nThat pitiful rumour may report my flight,\nTo consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!\nFor with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.\nTo Saint Jaques le Grand.\nWhere do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?\nIs this the way?\nIs it yourself?\nI thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.\nI did so.\nHis name, I pray you.\nBut by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:\nHis face I know not.\nAy, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.\nWhat's his name?\nO, I believe with him,\nIn argument of praise, or to the worth\nOf the great count himself, she is too mean\nTo have her name repeated: all her deserving\nIs a reserved honesty, and that\nI have not heard examined.\nHow do you mean?\nMay be the amorous count solicits her\nIn the unlawful purpose.\nWhich is the Frenchman?\nI like him well.\nWhich is he?\nPerchance he's hurt i' the battle.\nI humbly thank you:\nPlease it this matron and this gentle maid\nTo eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking\nShall be for me; and, to requite you further,\nI will bestow some precepts of this virgin\nWorthy the note.\nIf you misdoubt me that I am not she,\nI know not how I shall assure you further,\nBut I shall lose the grounds I work upon.\nNor would I wish you.\nFirst, give me trust, the count he is my husband,\nAnd what to your sworn counsel I have spoken\nIs so from word to word; and then you cannot,\nBy the good aid that I of you shall borrow,\nErr in bestowing it.\nTake this purse of gold,\nAnd let me buy your friendly help thus far,\nWhich I will over-pay and pay again\nWhen I have found it.

How oddly he is suited!\nI think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round\nhose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his\nbehavior every where.\nThat he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he\nborrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and\nswore he would pay him again when he was able: I\nthink the Frenchman became his surety and sealed\nunder for another.\nVery vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and\nmost vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when\nhe is best, he is a little worse than a man, and\nwhen he is worst, he is little better than a beast:\nand the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall\nmake shift to go without him.\nTherefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a\ndeep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,\nfor if the devil be within and that temptation\nwithout, I know he will choose it. I will do any\nthing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.\nIf I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as\nchaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner\nof my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers\nare so reasonable, for there is not one among them\nbut I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant\nthem a fair departure.\nYes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.\nI remember him well, and I remember him worthy of\nthy praise.\nHow now! what news?\nIf I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a\nheart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should\nbe glad of his approach: if he have the condition\nof a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had\nrather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,\nNerissa. Sirrah, go before.\nWhiles we shut the gates\nupon one wooer, another knocks at the door.\nIn terms of choice I am not solely led\nBy nice direction of a maiden's eyes;\nBesides, the lottery of my destiny\nBars me the right of voluntary choosing:\nBut if my father had not scanted me\nAnd hedged me by his wit, to yield myself\nHis wife who wins me by that means I told you,\nYourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair\nAs any comer I have look'd on yet\nFor my affection.\nYou must take your chance,\nAnd either not attempt to choose at all\nOr swear before you choose, if you choose wrong\nNever to speak to lady afterward\nIn way of marriage: therefore be advised.\nFirst, forward to the temple: after dinner\nYour hazard shall be made.\nGo draw aside the curtains and discover\nThe several caskets to this noble prince.\nNow make your choice.\nThe one of them contains my picture, prince:\nIf you choose that, then I am yours withal.\nThere, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,\nThen I am yours.\nA gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.\nLet all of his complexion choose me so.\nBehold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:\nIf you choose that wherein I am contain'd,\nStraight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:\nBut if you fail, without more speech, my lord,\nYou must be gone from hence immediately.\nTo these injunctions every one doth swear\nThat comes to hazard for my worthless self.\nToo long a pause for that which you find there.\nTo offend, and judge, are distinct offices\nAnd of opposed natures.\nThus hath the candle singed the moth.\nO, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,\nThey have the wisdom by their wit to lose.\nCome, draw the curtain, Nerissa.\nHere: what would my lord?\nNo more, I pray thee: I am half afeard\nThou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,\nThou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.\nCome, come, Nerissa; for I long to see\nQuick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.\nI pray you, tarry: pause a day or two\nBefore you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,\nI lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.\nThere's something tells me, but it is not love,\nI would not lose you; and you know yourself,\nHate counsels not in such a quality.\nBut lest you should not understand me well,\xe2\x80\x94\nAnd yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,\xe2\x80\x94\nI would detain you here some month or two\nBefore you venture for me. I could teach you\nHow to choose right, but I am then forsworn;\nSo will I never be: so may you miss me;\nBut if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,\nThat I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,\nThey have o'erlook'd me and divided me;\nOne half of me is yours, the other half yours,\nMine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,\nAnd so all yours. O, these naughty times\nPut bars between the owners and their rights!\nAnd so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,\nLet fortune go to hell for it, not I.\nI speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,\nTo eke it and to draw it out in length,\nTo stay you from election.\nUpon the rack, Bassanio! then confess\nWhat treason there is mingled with your love.\nAy, but I fear you speak upon the rack,\nWhere men enforced do speak anything.\nWell then, confess and live.\nAway, then! I am lock'd in one of them:\nIf you do love me, you will find me out.\nNerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.\nLet music sound while he doth make his choice;\nThen, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,\nFading in music: that the comparison\nMay stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream\nAnd watery death-bed for him. He may win;\nAnd what is music then? Then music is\nEven as the flourish when true subjects bow\nTo a new-crowned monarch: such it is\nAs are those dulcet sounds in break of day\nThat creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,\nAnd summon him to marriage. Now he goes,\nWith no less presence, but with much more love,\nThan young Alcides, when he did redeem\nThe virgin tribute paid by howling Troy\nTo the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice\nThe rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,\nWith bleared visages, come forth to view\nThe issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!\nLive thou, I live: with much, much more dismay\nI view the fight than thou that makest the fray.\nTell me where is fancy bred,\nOr in the heart, or in the head?\nHow begot, how nourished?\nReply, reply.\nIt is engender'd in the eyes,\nWith gazing fed; and fancy dies\nIn the cradle where it lies.\nLet us all ring fancy's knell\nI'll begin it,\xe2\x80\x94Ding, dong, bell.\nHow all the other passions fleet to air,\nAs doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,\nAnd shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,\nBe moderate; allay thy ecstasy,\nIn measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.\nI feel too much thy blessing: make it less,\nFor fear I surfeit.\nYou see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,\nSuch as I am: though for myself alone\nI would not be ambitious in my wish,\nTo wish myself much better; yet, for you\nI would be trebled twenty times myself;\nA thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;\nThat only to stand high in your account,\nI might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,\nExceed account; but the full sum of me\nIs sum of something, which, to term in gross,\nIs an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;\nHappy in this, she is not yet so old\nBut she may learn; happier than this,\nShe is not bred so dull but she can learn;\nHappiest of all is that her gentle spirit\nCommits itself to yours to be directed,\nAs from her lord, her governor, her king.\nMyself and what is mine to you and yours\nIs now converted: but now I was the lord\nOf this fair mansion, master of my servants,\nQueen o'er myself: and even now, but now,\nThis house, these servants and this same myself\nAre yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;\nWhich when you part from, lose, or give away,\nLet it presage the ruin of your love\nAnd be my vantage to exclaim on you.\nIs this true, Nerissa?\nSo do I, my lord:\nThey are entirely welcome.\nThere are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,\nThat steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:\nSome dear friend dead; else nothing in the world\nCould turn so much the constitution\nOf any constant man. What, worse and worse!\nWith leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,\nAnd I must freely have the half of anything\nThat this same paper brings you.\nIs it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?\nWhat sum owes he the Jew?\nWhat, no more?\nPay him six thousand, and deface the bond;\nDouble six thousand, and then treble that,\nBefore a friend of this description\nShall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.\nFirst go with me to church and call me wife,\nAnd then away to Venice to your friend;\nFor never shall you lie by Portia's side\nWith an unquiet soul. You shall have gold\nTo pay the petty debt twenty times over:\nWhen it is paid, bring your true friend along.\nMy maid Nerissa and myself meantime\nWill live as maids and widows. Come, away!\nFor you shall hence upon your wedding-day:\nBid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:\nSince you are dear bought, I will love you dear.\nBut let me hear the letter of your friend.\nO love, dispatch all business, and be gone!\nI never did repent for doing good,\nNor shall not now: for in companions\nThat do converse and waste the time together,\nWhose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,\nThere must be needs a like proportion\nOf lineaments, of manners and of spirit;\nWhich makes me think that this Antonio,\nBeing the bosom lover of my lord,\nMust needs be like my lord. If it be so,\nHow little is the cost I have bestow'd\nIn purchasing the semblance of my soul\nFrom out the state of hellish misery!\nThis comes too near the praising of myself;\nTherefore no more of it: hear other things.\nLorenzo, I commit into your hands\nThe husbandry and manage of my house\nUntil my lord's return: for mine own part,\nI have toward heaven breathed a secret vow\nTo live in prayer and contemplation,\nOnly attended by Nerissa here,\nUntil her husband and my lord's return:\nThere is a monastery two miles off;\nAnd there will we abide. I do desire you\nNot to deny this imposition;\nThe which my love and some necessity\nNow lays upon you.\nMy people do already know my mind,\nAnd will acknowledge you and Jessica\nIn place of Lord Bassanio and myself.\nAnd so farewell, till we shall meet again.\nI thank you for your wish, and am well pleased\nTo wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.\nNow, Balthasar,\nAs I have ever found thee honest-true,\nSo let me find thee still. Take this same letter,\nAnd use thou all the endeavour of a man\nIn speed to Padua: see thou render this\nInto my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;\nAnd, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,\nBring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed\nUnto the tranect, to the common ferry\nWhich trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,\nBut get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.\nCome on, Nerissa; I have work in hand\nThat you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands\nBefore they think of us.\nThey shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,\nThat they shall think we are accomplished\nWith that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,\nWhen we are both accoutred like young men,\nI'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,\nAnd wear my dagger with the braver grace,\nAnd speak between the change of man and boy\nWith a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps\nInto a manly stride, and speak of frays\nLike a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,\nHow honourable ladies sought my love,\nWhich I denying, they fell sick and died;\nI could not do withal; then I'll repent,\nAnd wish for all that, that I had not killed them;\nAnd twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,\nThat men shall swear I have discontinued school\nAbove a twelvemonth. I have within my mind\nA thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,\nWhich I will practise.\nFie, what a question's that,\nIf thou wert near a lewd interpreter!\nBut come, I'll tell thee all my whole device\nWhen I am in my coach, which stays for us\nAt the park gate; and therefore haste away,\nFor we must measure twenty miles to-day.\nI did, my lord.\nI am informed thoroughly of the cause.\nWhich is the merchant here, and which the Jew?\nIs your name Shylock?\nOf a strange nature is the suit you follow;\nYet in such rule that the Venetian law\nCannot impugn you as you do proceed.\nYou stand within his danger, do you not?\nDo you confess the bond?\nThen must the Jew be merciful.\nThe quality of mercy is not strain'd,\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\nUpon the place beneath: it is twice blest;\nIt blesseth him that gives and him that takes:\n'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes\nThe throned monarch better than his crown;\nHis sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\nThe attribute to awe and majesty,\nWherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\nBut mercy is above this sceptred sway;\nIt is enthroned in the hearts of kings,\nIt is an attribute to God himself;\nAnd earthly power doth then show likest God's\nWhen mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\nThough justice be thy plea, consider this,\nThat, in the course of justice, none of us\nShould see salvation: we do pray for mercy;\nAnd that same prayer doth teach us all to render\nThe deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much\nTo mitigate the justice of thy plea;\nWhich if thou follow, this strict court of Venice\nMust needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.\nIs he not able to discharge the money?\nIt must not be; there is no power in Venice\nCan alter a decree established:\n'Twill be recorded for a precedent,\nAnd many an error by the same example\nWill rush into the state: it cannot be.\nI pray you, let me look upon the bond.\nShylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.\nWhy, this bond is forfeit;\nAnd lawfully by this the Jew may claim\nA pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\nNearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:\nTake thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.\nWhy then, thus it is:\nYou must prepare your bosom for his knife.\nFor the intent and purpose of the law\nHath full relation to the penalty,\nWhich here appeareth due upon the bond.\nTherefore lay bare your bosom.\nIt is so. Are there balance here to weigh\nThe flesh?\nHave by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,\nTo stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.\nIt is not so express'd: but what of that?\n'Twere good you do so much for charity.\nYou, merchant, have you any thing to say?\nYour wife would give you little thanks for that,\nIf she were by, to hear you make the offer.\nA pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:\nThe court awards it, and the law doth give it.\nAnd you must cut this flesh from off his breast:\nThe law allows it, and the court awards it.\nTarry a little; there is something else.\nThis bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;\nThe words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'\nTake then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;\nBut, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed\nOne drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods\nAre, by the laws of Venice, confiscate\nUnto the state of Venice.\nThyself shalt see the act:\nFor, as thou urgest justice, be assured\nThou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.\nSoft!\nThe Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:\nHe shall have nothing but the penalty.\nTherefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.\nShed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more\nBut just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more\nOr less than a just pound, be it but so much\nAs makes it light or heavy in the substance,\nOr the division of the twentieth part\nOf one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn\nBut in the estimation of a hair,\nThou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.\nWhy doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.\nHe hath refused it in the open court:\nHe shall have merely justice and his bond.\nThou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,\nTo be so taken at thy peril, Jew.\nTarry, Jew:\nThe law hath yet another hold on you.\nIt is enacted in the laws of Venice,\nIf it be proved against an alien\nThat by direct or indirect attempts\nHe seek the life of any citizen,\nThe party 'gainst the which he doth contrive\nShall seize one half his goods; the other half\nComes to the privy coffer of the state;\nAnd the offender's life lies in the mercy\nOf the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.\nIn which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;\nFor it appears, by manifest proceeding,\nThat indirectly and directly too\nThou hast contrived against the very life\nOf the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd\nThe danger formerly by me rehearsed.\nDown therefore and beg mercy of the duke.\nAy, for the state, not for Antonio.\nWhat mercy can you render him, Antonio?\nArt thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?\nClerk, draw a deed of gift.\nI humbly do desire your grace of pardon:\nI must away this night toward Padua,\nAnd it is meet I presently set forth.\nHe is well paid that is well satisfied;\nAnd I, delivering you, am satisfied\nAnd therein do account myself well paid:\nMy mind was never yet more mercenary.\nI pray you, know me when we meet again:\nI wish you well, and so I take my leave.\nYou press me far, and therefore I will yield.\nGive me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;\nAnd, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:\nDo not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;\nAnd you in love shall not deny me this.\nI will have nothing else but only this;\nAnd now methinks I have a mind to it.\nI see, sir, you are liberal in offers\nYou taught me first to beg; and now methinks\nYou teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.\nThat 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.\nAn if your wife be not a mad-woman,\nAnd know how well I have deserved the ring,\nShe would not hold out enemy for ever,\nFor giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!\nInquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed\nAnd let him sign it: we'll away to-night\nAnd be a day before our husbands home:\nThis deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.\nThat cannot be:\nHis ring I do accept most thankfully:\nAnd so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,\nI pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.\nThou mayst, I warrant.\nWe shall have old swearing\nThat they did give the rings away to men;\nBut we'll outface them, and outswear them too.\nAway! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.\nThat light we see is burning in my hall.\nHow far that little candle throws his beams!\nSo shines a good deed in a naughty world.\nSo doth the greater glory dim the less:\nA substitute shines brightly as a king\nUnto the king be by, and then his state\nEmpties itself, as doth an inland brook\nInto the main of waters. Music! hark!\nNothing is good, I see, without respect:\nMethinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.\nThe crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,\nWhen neither is attended, and I think\nThe nightingale, if she should sing by day,\nWhen every goose is cackling, would be thought\nNo better a musician than the wren.\nHow many things by season season'd are\nTo their right praise and true perfection!\nPeace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion\nAnd would not be awaked.\nHe knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,\nBy the bad voice.\nWe have been praying for our husbands' healths,\nWhich speed, we hope, the better for our words.\nAre they return'd?\nGo in, Nerissa;\nGive order to my servants that they take\nNo note at all of our being absent hence;\nNor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.\nThis night methinks is but the daylight sick;\nIt looks a little paler: 'tis a day,\nSuch as the day is when the sun is hid.\nLet me give light, but let me not be light;\nFor a light wife doth make a heavy husband,\nAnd never be Bassanio so for me:\nBut God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.\nYou should in all sense be much bound to him.\nFor, as I hear, he was much bound for you.\nSir, you are very welcome to our house:\nIt must appear in other ways than words,\nTherefore I scant this breathing courtesy.\nA quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?\nYou were to blame, I must be plain with you,\nTo part so slightly with your wife's first gift:\nA thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger\nAnd so riveted with faith unto your flesh.\nI gave my love a ring and made him swear\nNever to part with it; and here he stands;\nI dare be sworn for him he would not leave it\nNor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth\nThat the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,\nYou give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:\nAn 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.\nWhat ring gave you my lord?\nNot that, I hope, which you received of me.\nEven so void is your false heart of truth.\nBy heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed\nUntil I see the ring.\nIf you had known the virtue of the ring,\nOr half her worthiness that gave the ring,\nOr your own honour to contain the ring,\nYou would not then have parted with the ring.\nWhat man is there so much unreasonable,\nIf you had pleased to have defended it\nWith any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty\nTo urge the thing held as a ceremony?\nNerissa teaches me what to believe:\nI'll die for't but some woman had the ring.\nLet not that doctor e'er come near my house:\nSince he hath got the jewel that I loved,\nAnd that which you did swear to keep for me,\nI will become as liberal as you;\nI'll not deny him any thing I have,\nNo, not my body nor my husband's bed:\nKnow him I shall, I am well sure of it:\nLie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:\nIf you do not, if I be left alone,\nNow, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,\nI'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.\nSir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.\nMark you but that!\nIn both my eyes he doubly sees himself;\nIn each eye, one: swear by your double self,\nAnd there's an oath of credit.\nThen you shall be his surety. Give him this\nAnd bid him keep it better than the other.\nI had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;\nFor, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.\nSpeak not so grossly. You are all amazed:\nHere is a letter; read it at your leisure;\nIt comes from Padua, from Bellario:\nThere you shall find that Portia was the doctor,\nNerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here\nShall witness I set forth as soon as you\nAnd even but now return'd; I have not yet\nEnter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;\nAnd I have better news in store for you\nThan you expect: unseal this letter soon;\nThere you shall find three of your argosies\nAre richly come to harbour suddenly:\nYou shall not know by what strange accident\nI chanced on this letter.\nHow now, Lorenzo!\nMy clerk hath some good comforts too for you.\nIt is almost morning,\nAnd yet I am sure you are not satisfied\nOf these events at full. Let us go in;\nAnd charge us there upon inter'gatories,\nAnd we will answer all things faithfully.\n", 'F'), ("Good time of day unto your royal grace!\nMadam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.\nMadam, we did: he desires to make atonement\nBetwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,\nAnd betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;\nAnd sent to warn them to his royal presence.\nNorthumberland, then present, wept to see it.\nHave done! for shame, if not for charity.\nHave done, have done.\nNor no one here; for curses never pass\nThe lips of those that breathe them in the air.\nNothing that I respect, my gracious lord.\nWhenever Buckingham doth turn his hate\nOn you or yours,\nbut with all duteous love\nDoth cherish you and yours, God punish me\nWith hate in those where I expect most love!\nWhen I have most need to employ a friend,\nAnd most assured that he is a friend\nDeep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,\nBe he unto me! this do I beg of God,\nWhen I am cold in zeal to yours.\nAnd, in good time, here comes the noble duke.\nLook I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?\nWe wait upon your grace.\nYou cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,\nThat bear this mutual heavy load of moan,\nNow cheer each other in each other's love\nThough we have spent our harvest of this king,\nWe are to reap the harvest of his son.\nThe broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,\nBut lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,\nMust gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:\nMe seemeth good, that, with some little train,\nForthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd\nHither to London, to be crown'd our king.\nMarry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,\nThe new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,\nWhich would be so much the more dangerous\nBy how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:\nWhere every horse bears his commanding rein,\nAnd may direct his course as please himself,\nAs well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,\nIn my opinion, ought to be prevented.\nMy lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,\nFor God's sake, let not us two be behind;\nFor, by the way, I'll sort occasion,\nAs index to the story we late talk'd of,\nTo part the queen's proud kindred from the king.\nWelcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.\nAnd, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.\nFie, what an indirect and peevish course\nIs this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace\nPersuade the queen to send the Duke of York\nUnto his princely brother presently?\nIf she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,\nAnd from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.\nYou are too senseless\xe2\x80\x94obstinate, my lord,\nToo ceremonious and traditional\nWeigh it but with the grossness of this age,\nYou break not sanctuary in seizing him.\nThe benefit thereof is always granted\nTo those whose dealings have deserved the place,\nAnd those who have the wit to claim the place:\nThis prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;\nAnd therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:\nThen, taking him from thence that is not there,\nYou break no privilege nor charter there.\nOft have I heard of sanctuary men;\nBut sanctuary children ne'er till now.\nHe did, my gracious lord, begin that place;\nWhich, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.\nUpon record, my gracious lord.\nWhat, my gracious lord?\nNow, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.\nWith what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!\nTo mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,\nHe prettily and aptly taunts himself:\nSo cunning and so young is wonderful.\nThink you, my lord, this little prating York\nWas not incensed by his subtle mother\nTo taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?\nWell, let them rest.

Then, true Pisanio,\xe2\x80\x94\nWho long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,\xe2\x80\x94\nlet me bate,-but not like me\xe2\x80\x94yet long'st,\nBut in a fainter kind:\xe2\x80\x94O, not like me;\nFor mine's beyond beyond\xe2\x80\x94say, and speak thick;\nLove's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,\nTo the smothering of the sense\xe2\x80\x94how far it is\nTo this same blessed Milford: and by the way\nTell me how Wales was made so happy as\nTo inherit such a haven: but first of all,\nHow we may steal from hence, and for the gap\nThat we shall make in time, from our hence-going\nAnd our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:\nWhy should excuse be born or e'er begot?\nWe'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,\nHow many score of miles may we well ride\n'Twixt hour and hour?\nWhy, one that rode to's execution, man,\nCould never go so slow: I have heard of\nriding wagers,\nWhere horses have been nimbler than the sands\nThat run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:\nGo bid my woman feign a sickness; say\nShe'll home to her father: and provide me presently\nA riding-suit, no costlier than would fit\nA franklin's housewife.\nI see before me, man: nor here, nor here,\nNor what ensues, but have a fog in them,\nThat I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;\nDo as I bid thee: there's no more to say,\nAccessible is none but Milford way.\nThou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place\nWas near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so\nTo see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!\nWhere is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,\nThat makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh\nFrom the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,\nWould be interpreted a thing perplex'd\nBeyond self-explication: put thyself\nInto a havior of less fear, ere wildness\nVanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?\nWhy tender'st thou that paper to me, with\nA look untender? If't be summer news,\nSmile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st\nBut keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!\nThat drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,\nAnd he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue\nMay take off some extremity, which to read\nWould be even mortal to me.\n'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the\nstrumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie\nbleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,\nbut from proof as strong as my grief and as certain\nas I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,\nmust act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with\nthe breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away\nher life: I shall give thee opportunity at\nMilford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose\nwhere, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain\nit is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and\nequally to me disloyal.'\nFalse to his bed! What is it to be false?\nTo lie in watch there and to think on him?\nTo weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep\ncharge nature,\nTo break it with a fearful dream of him\nAnd cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?\nI false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,\nThou didst accuse him of incontinency;\nThou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks\nThy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy\nWhose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:\nPoor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;\nAnd, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,\nI must be ripp'd:\xe2\x80\x94to pieces with me!\xe2\x80\x94O,\nMen's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,\nBy thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought\nPut on for villany; not born where't grows,\nBut worn a bait for ladies.\nTrue honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,\nWere in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping\nDid scandal many a holy tear, took pity\nFrom most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,\nWilt lay the leaven on all proper men;\nGoodly and gallant shall be false and perjured\nFrom thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:\nDo thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,\nA little witness my obedience: look!\nI draw the sword myself: take it, and hit\nThe innocent mansion of my love, my heart;\nFear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;\nThy master is not there, who was indeed\nThe riches of it: do his bidding; strike\nThou mayst be valiant in a better cause;\nBut now thou seem'st a coward.\nWhy, I must die;\nAnd if I do not by thy hand, thou art\nNo servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter\nThere is a prohibition so divine\nThat cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.\nSomething's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;\nObedient as the scabbard. What is here?\nThe scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,\nAll turn'd to heresy? Away, away,\nCorrupters of my faith! you shall no more\nBe stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools\nBelieve false teachers: though those that\nare betray'd\nDo feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor\nStands in worse case of woe.\nAnd thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up\nMy disobedience 'gainst the king my father\nAnd make me put into contempt the suits\nOf princely fellows, shalt hereafter find\nIt is no act of common passage, but\nA strain of rareness: and I grieve myself\nTo think, when thou shalt be disedged by her\nThat now thou tirest on, how thy memory\nWill then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:\nThe lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?\nThou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,\nWhen I desire it too.\nDo't, and to bed then.\nWherefore then\nDidst undertake it? Why hast thou abused\nSo many miles with a pretence? this place?\nMine action and thine own? our horses' labour?\nThe time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,\nFor my being absent? whereunto I never\nPurpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,\nTo be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,\nThe elected deer before thee?\nTalk thy tongue weary; speak\nI have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear\nTherein false struck, can take no greater wound,\nNor tent to bottom that. But speak.\nMost like;\nBringing me here to kill me.\nSome Roman courtezan.\nWhy good fellow,\nWhat shall I do the where? where bide? how live?\nOr in my life what comfort, when I am\nDead to my husband?\nNo court, no father; nor no more ado\nWith that harsh, noble, simple nothing,\nThat Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me\nAs fearful as a siege.\nWhere then\nHath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,\nAre they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume\nOur Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;\nIn a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think\nThere's livers out of Britain.\nO, for such means!\nThough peril to my modesty, not death on't,\nI would adventure.\nNay, be brief\nI see into thy end, and am almost\nA man already.\nThou art all the comfort\nThe gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:\nThere's more to be consider'd; but we'll even\nAll that good time will give us: this attempt\nI am soldier to, and will abide it with\nA prince's courage. Away, I prithee.\nAmen: I thank thee.\nI see a man's life is a tedious one:\nI have tired myself, and for two nights together\nHave made the ground my bed. I should be sick,\nBut that my resolution helps me. Milford,\nWhen from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,\nThou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think\nFoundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,\nWhere they should be relieved. Two beggars told me\nI could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,\nThat have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis\nA punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,\nWhen rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness\nIs sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood\nIs worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!\nThou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,\nMy hunger's gone; but even before, I was\nAt point to sink for food. But what is this?\nHere is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:\nI were best not to call; I dare not call:\nyet famine,\nEre clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,\nPlenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever\nOf hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?\nIf any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,\nTake or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.\nBest draw my sword: and if mine enemy\nBut fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.\nSuch a foe, good heavens!\nGood masters, harm me not:\nBefore I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought\nTo have begg'd or bought what I have took:\ngood troth,\nI have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found\nGold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:\nI would have left it on the board so soon\nAs I had made my meal, and parted\nWith prayers for the provider.\nI see you're angry:\nKnow, if you kill me for my fault, I should\nHave died had I not made it.\nTo Milford-Haven.\nFidele, sir. I have a kinsman who\nIs bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;\nTo whom being going, almost spent with hunger,\nI am fall'n in this offence.\n'Mongst friends,\nIf brothers.\nWould it had been so, that they\nHad been my father's sons! then had my prize\nBeen less, and so more equal ballasting\nTo thee, Posthumus.\nGreat men,\nThat had a court no bigger than this cave,\nThat did attend themselves and had the virtue\nWhich their own conscience seal'd them\xe2\x80\x94laying by\nThat nothing-gift of differing multitudes\xe2\x80\x94\nCould not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!\nI'd change my sex to be companion with them,\nSince Leonatus's false.\nThanks, sir.\nSo man and man should be;\nBut clay and clay differs in dignity,\nWhose dust is both alike. I am very sick.\nSo sick I am not, yet I am not well;\nBut not so citizen a wanton as\nTo seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;\nStick to your journal course: the breach of custom\nIs breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me\nCannot amend me; society is no comfort\nTo one not sociable: I am not very sick,\nSince I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:\nI'll rob none but myself; and let me die,\nStealing so poorly.\nI wish ye sport.\nThese are kind creatures. Gods, what lies\nI have heard!\nOur courtiers say all's savage but at court:\nExperience, O, thou disprovest report!\nThe imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish\nPoor tributary rivers as sweet fish.\nI am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,\nI'll now taste of thy drug.\nWell or ill,\nI am bound to you.\nYes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is\nthe way?\xe2\x80\x94\nI thank you.\xe2\x80\x94By yond bush?\xe2\x80\x94Pray, how far thither?\n'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?\xe2\x80\x94\nI have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.\nBut, soft! no bedfellow!\xe2\x80\x94O gods and goddesses!\nThese flowers are like the pleasures of the world;\nThis bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;\nFor so I thought I was a cave-keeper,\nAnd cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;\n'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,\nWhich the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes\nAre sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,\nI tremble stiff with fear: but if there be\nYet left in heaven as small a drop of pity\nAs a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!\nThe dream's here still: even when I wake, it is\nWithout me, as within me; not imagined, felt.\nA headless man! The garments of Posthumus!\nI know the shape of's leg: this is his hand;\nHis foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;\nThe brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face\nMurder in heaven?\xe2\x80\x94How!\xe2\x80\x94'Tis gone. Pisanio,\nAll curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,\nAnd mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,\nConspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,\nHast here cut off my lord. To write and read\nBe henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio\nHath with his forged letters,\xe2\x80\x94damn'd Pisanio\xe2\x80\x94\nFrom this most bravest vessel of the world\nStruck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,\nWhere is thy head? where's that? Ay me!\nwhere's that?\nPisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,\nAnd left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?\n'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them\nHave laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!\nThe drug he gave me, which he said was precious\nAnd cordial to me, have I not found it\nMurderous to the senses? That confirms it home:\nThis is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!\nGive colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,\nThat we the horrider may seem to those\nWhich chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!\nI am nothing: or if not,\nNothing to be were better. This was my master,\nA very valiant Briton and a good,\nThat here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!\nThere is no more such masters: I may wander\nFrom east to occident, cry out for service,\nTry many, all good, serve truly, never\nFind such another master.\nRichard du Champ.\nIf I do lie and do\nNo harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope\nThey'll pardon it.\xe2\x80\x94Say you, sir?\nFidele, sir.\nI'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,\nI'll hide my master from the flies, as deep\nAs these poor pickaxes can dig; and when\nWith wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,\nAnd on it said a century of prayers,\nSuch as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;\nAnd leaving so his service, follow you,\nSo please you entertain me.\nI humbly thank your highness.\nNo, no: alack,\nThere's other work in hand: I see a thing\nBitter to me as death: your life, good master,\nMust shuffle for itself.\nHe is a Roman; no more kin to me\nThan I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,\nAm something nearer.\nI'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please\nTo give me hearing.\nFidele, sir.\nMy boon is, that this gentleman may render\nOf whom he had this ring.\nPeace, my lord; hear, hear\xe2\x80\x94\nO, get thee from my sight;\nThou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!\nBreathe not where princes are.\nIt poison'd me.\nMost like I did, for I was dead.\nWhy did you throw your wedded lady from you?\nThink that you are upon a rock; and now\nThrow me again.\nYour blessing, sir.\nI am sorry for't, my lord.\nThat headless man\nI thought had been my lord.\nNo, my lord;\nI have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,\nHave we thus met? O, never say hereafter\nBut I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,\nWhen I was but your sister; I you brothers,\nWhen ye were so indeed.\nYou are my father too, and did relieve me,\nTo see this gracious season.\nMy good master,\nI will yet do you service.\n", 'F'), ("These your unusual weeds to each part of you\nDo give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora\nPeering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing\nIs as a meeting of the petty gods,\nAnd you the queen on't.\nI bless the time\nWhen my good falcon made her flight across\nThy father's ground.\nApprehend\nNothing but jollity. The gods themselves,\nHumbling their deities to love, have taken\nThe shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter\nBecame a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune\nA ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,\nGolden Apollo, a poor humble swain,\nAs I seem now. Their transformations\nWere never for a piece of beauty rarer,\nNor in a way so chaste, since my desires\nRun not before mine honour, nor my lusts\nBurn hotter than my faith.\nThou dearest Perdita,\nWith these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not\nThe mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,\nOr not my father's. For I cannot be\nMine own, nor any thing to any, if\nI be not thine. To this I am most constant,\nThough destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;\nStrangle such thoughts as these with any thing\nThat you behold the while. Your guests are coming:\nLift up your countenance, as it were the day\nOf celebration of that nuptial which\nWe two have sworn shall come.\nSee, your guests approach:\nAddress yourself to entertain them sprightly,\nAnd let's be red with mirth.\nWhat, like a corse?\nWhat you do\nStill betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.\nI'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,\nI'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,\nPray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,\nTo sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you\nA wave o' the sea, that you might ever do\nNothing but that; move still, still so,\nAnd own no other function: each your doing,\nSo singular in each particular,\nCrowns what you are doing in the present deed,\nThat all your acts are queens.\nI think you have\nAs little skill to fear as I have purpose\nTo put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:\nYour hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,\nThat never mean to part.\nOld sir, I know\nShe prizes not such trifles as these are:\nThe gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd\nUp in my heart; which I have given already,\nBut not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life\nBefore this ancient sir, who, it should seem,\nHath sometime loved!
