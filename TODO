TODO

x different algorithms, cross-validation
    x NaiveBayes -- sucks
    x SVM - sucks

X figure out why Naive Bayes and SVM suck with this feature set, try with
  different feature sets

x nahhh - another feature to try -- "I" or "me" in the same sentence as male or female
  name

x try combining svm features (maybe just binary features, read more about this)
    - takes too long -- over 10 mins

- add cross-validation

^^ above by EOD Friday

- get results for how humans perform at classification; inspired by 
  http://thekeesh.com/cs224n/final_writeup.pdf

- later: merge features into one-pass?

- fix, comment better token_stats.py - call it vocab_gen or something

- after done with Shakespeare, try to eval author gender.
- after that, try to classify modern texts; then, train on modern texts and
  test on Shakespeare

- dockerify for easy running - see README.md for what to do

- ask if you can do week 10 quiz
