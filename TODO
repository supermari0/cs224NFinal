TODO
- decide on classification algorithms and feature sets
    - implement algorithms -- look into nltk, ML libs from 229, stuff from
      cs124
- decide on evaluation framework - see classification literature, cs229
    - probably just simple precision/recall/accuracy/f1

- after done with Shakespeare, try to eval author gender.
- after that, try to classify modern texts; then, train on modern texts and
  test on Shakespeare

- dockerify for easy running - see README.md for what to do

- ask if you can do week 10 quiz
