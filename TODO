TODO

- different algorithms, cross-validation
    x NaiveBayes -- sucks
    x SVM - sucks

- figure out why Naive Bayes and SVM suck with this feature set, try with
  different feature sets

- another feature to try -- "I" or "me" in the same sentence as male or female
  name

- later: merge features into one-pass?, add command line args for different
    classifiers, different train/test sets

- fix, comment better token_stats.py - call it vocab_gen or something


- after done with Shakespeare, try to eval author gender.
- after that, try to classify modern texts; then, train on modern texts and
  test on Shakespeare

- dockerify for easy running - see README.md for what to do

- ask if you can do week 10 quiz
