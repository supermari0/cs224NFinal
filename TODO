TODO

x different algorithms, cross-validation
    x NaiveBayes -- sucks
    x SVM - sucks

X figure out why Naive Bayes and SVM suck with this feature set, try with
  different feature sets

x nahhh - another feature to try -- "I" or "me" in the same sentence as male or female
  name

x try combining svm features (maybe just binary features, read more about this)
    - takes too long -- over 10 mins

X add cross-validation
x separate 5fold, test, and dev options. make kfold have arbitrary k


X finish up inline documentation for *all* files
- add option for quadratic computation with SVM
- evaluate kfold results with different k/algorithms, record
- get results for how humans perform at classification; inspired by 
  http://thekeesh.com/cs224n/final_writeup.pdf
- start writing paper

- after done with Shakespeare, try to eval author gender.
- after that, try to classify modern texts; then, train on modern texts and
  test on Shakespeare

- dockerify for easy running - see README.md for what to do

- ask if you can do week 10 quiz
